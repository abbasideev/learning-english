- We love you!
- We love you, Elisabeth!

3

- Please!
- Over here!

4

Oh my God, we love you!

5

I love her.

6

Sparkle!

7

...my favourite.

8

Wanna get something to eat?

9

Yeah, I'll get a pretzel,
or something.

10

- Remember her?
- She was in that movie... Uh!

11

We're gonna have to let her
know we're gonna be late.

12

Yeah, I'll give her a text.

13

He owes me 20 bucks.

14

Get out the way!

15

<i>Vamos</i>!

16

Shit!

17

You got it!

18

Feel that power, ladies!

19

And march! Get those knees up.

20

You got it!

21

Come on!

22

Front.

23

Kick!

24

Kick!

25

Oh yeah, you got it!

26

Square.

27

Think about those bikini bods.

28

You wanna look
like a giant jellyfish on the beach?

29

Come on.

30

Cross.

31

Push.

32

Kick! Come on, you got it!

33

Hang in there, ladies, you've got it.

34

You've got it!

35

Whoo!

36

Great workout, ladies.

37

Alright, I hope I see you next week
for <i>Sparkle Your Life</i>.

38

We're gonna work on the lateral abs,

39

you know,
the most difficult part to sculpt.

40

But in the meantime,

41

take care of yourself.

42

Move it back, position one.

43

Great job, ladies.

44

You got it.

45

Alright,
get these lights down for me.

46

- Happy birthday!
- Oh, thank you.

47

- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

48

- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

49

I don't care if we have to see every
fucking young girl in this fucking town

50

in the next few weeks!

51

Look,

52

I'll make it simple.

53

We need her young.

54

We need her hot.

55

We need her now.

56

How the old bitch has been able
to stick around for this long,

57

that's the fucking mystery to me.

58

Oh, Oscar winner my ass.

59

When was that? Back in the 30s,

60

what, for <i>King Kong</i>?

61

<i>- ...promised her...</i>
- No.

62

I don't give a fuck
what we promised her!

63

This is network TV,
not a fucking charity.

64

Find me somebody new!

65

Now!

66

Hey, did you know that a woman's fertility
starts to decrease about the age of 25?

67

How old is Jennifer?

68

You better get busy!

69

<i>It's like when you see
someone fart on screen.</i>

70

People just love that.

71

I mean, that's just the way it is.

72

<i>C'est la vie.</i>

73

People are just people.

74

And I have to give people
what they want.

75

That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

76

And people always ask
for something new.

77

Renewal

78

is inevitable.

79

And at 50...

80

well...

81

it stops.

82

What stops?

83

What?

84

What stops?

85

Um...

86

you know, the...

87

the...

88

Oh, George!

89

Oh, oh!

90

I'm sorry, I gotta run.

91

Harvey!

92

George, those ratings are insane!

93

You're a genius!

94

Oh what a mensch, you're a genius!

95

Let's buy you a drink, come on.

96

Well, it's your lucky day,
Miss Sparkle,

97

'cause we have X-rayed
you from head to toe,

98

and you don't have so much
as a cracked molar.

99

So, you are good to go.

100

Um, vaccination, okay.

101

Not currently
on any medication.

102

By the way, I just want to say, my...

103

my wife is a huge fan.

104

Um...

105

Blood type...

106

Oh hey, it's your birthday!

107

Happy bir...

108

Oh, uh, that's an emergency,
I'm sorry, I have to...

109

Have a good...

110

Bye.

111

One moment.

112

There's just one last exam to perform.

113

I thought he said I was good to go.

114

- Is there a problem?
- No, it's perfect.

115

You're a good candidate.

116

I mean, you're good to go.

117

I wish you the best.

118

Lizzie?

119

Lizzie Sparkle?

120

Oh my God, I can't believe it.

121

Fred!

122

Fred, from 10th grade home room!

123

Oh...

124

Fred, of course!

125

You haven't changed a bit.

126

You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

127

You know, I followed your career.
What a success! I mean...

128

Wow, wow, wow!

129

Wow.

130

Hey...

131

Why don't we go out
maybe for a drink some time?

132

Now that we're,
you know, "reconnected".

133

Um...

134

- Oh, of course,
- I'm...

135

- I'm stupid, you're super busy.
- But you know what?

136

Why don't you give me your card?

137

I mean, you never know.

138

Um...

139

Here...

140

This will do.

141

Don't look at my cholesterol levels,
they're a disaster.

142

- Oh, God!
- Oh, that's...

143

There.

144

Now, you've got it!

145

Call me.

I don't know what you're talking about.

471

472

something bizarre on the monitor.

474

477

478

- Sorry, it's in your dressing room.
- Well then, go and get it!

479

Let's just take this frame by frame.

480

I need five minutes.

481

<i>- Yes?</i>
- This balance is not working!

482

483

No, he said "Now".

496

I'll get right to the point.

497

We can't keep you
on the morning show.

498

But why? I just started.

499

Ratings are through the roof.

500

We started at 42.

501

Now we're up to, like...

502

216.

503

It's phenomenal!

504

People love you!

505

They adore you!

506

They want more and more,

507

and more of you.

508

That is why we have decided

509

that we want you to host

510

the New Year's Eve show.

511

You mean the...

512

The network's biggest show.
Fifty million viewers.

513

Live.

514

You can't go higher than that!

515

Now, it's gonna be intense.

516

to pull it off, so...

517

Are you in?

518

If you don't open the door
when opportunity knocks

519

you won't get another chance.

520

You of all people know this.

521

Just one more day,
and then I have a whole week off

522

we can switch.

523

We're doing the cover of Vogue!

524

Just one more day, okay?

525

No!

526

542

No.

543

No, no, no...

544

I can't stop.

545

She...

546

I...

547

The balance just needs to be respected.

548

<i>So respect it.</i>

549

Just stop it. Stop it.

550

Stop it, stop it, stop it.

551

<i>Bob, you are the winner!</i>

552

<i>So Bob, congratulations,
you've won $25,000.</i>

553

<i>Now you have one final chance
to answer a single question</i>

554

<i>in our big question round
and play for $250,000!</i>

555

<i>Now, you'll have just 45 seconds...</i>

556

<i>Just a little something
to keep you busy.</i>

557

Fuck...

558

<i>Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
she is here.</i>

559

<i>The superstar</i>

560

<i>of the moment, Sue!</i>

561

<i>Are you ready? Let's welcome her!</i>

562

<i>Sue!</i>

563

You popped up out of nowhere
on our screens like a tornado!

564

I don't think anybody

565

was really prepared for this whirlwind.

566

It all started with the morning show.

567

And rumour has it,

568

that you are up
for Tom Grant's next movie.

569

<i>Ah, wait...</i>

570

just a moment.

571

I'm being told you are going to host

572

the New Year's Eve show,
can you confirm this?

573

Yes, that's right.

574

Yes, that's right.

575

Oh my God! That is huge news!

576

<i>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</i>

577

Where are you from,
how did you get discovered?

578

I want, we want to know everything.

579

Well, I mean...

580

there's really not very much to tell.

581

I'm just a girl

582

from a very small town in Indiana.

583

I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

584

In fact, it's not even a town.

585

I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village. It's...

586

a farm, perhaps?

587

<i>But, ever since I can remember,</i>

588

it has always been my dream

589

<i>to be on the screen.</i>

590

This is my dream.

591

As a child I used to put
on shows for my family.

592

Your family.

593

How sweet.

594

<i>So...</i>

595

everyone is aware

596

that you replaced

597

Elisabeth Sparkle.

598

And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

599

you turned up the volume,

600

and you rocked their world.

601

Were you a fan of her show?

602

Um...

603

<i>Well...</i>

604

Well, I can't...

605

I can't really say that I actually watched

606

<i>her show.</i>

607

You do know that we're not exactly
from the same generation.

608

And you have to admit

609

it was a bit old-fashioned.

610

Jurassic Fitness, really.

611

Jurassic Fitness?

612

It needed a change.

613

I'll fucking show you.

614

You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

615

You want it?

616

Come on,

617

come get
your fucking Jurassic Fitness!

618

But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

619

So every morning,

620

rain or shine,

621

<i>Sparkle Your Life</i> was on TV.

622

So, in a way, I grew up with her.

623

Whether I liked it or not.

624

I guess that's why you can say
we have some sort of connection.

625

"Some sort of connection."

626

You wouldn't exist

627

without me.

628

It is time, ladies and gentlemen,

629

for our final question.

630

The question that we ask

631

each and every one of our guests.

632

Okay.

633

Would you share one of your little

634

beauty secrets with us?

635

Just one little trick of yours

636

that helps you look so incredibly
stunning, I mean, look at you.

637

- I don't know...
- Say it!

638

Say it!

639

- Let me think.
- Say it.

640

Tell them
who your little beauty secret is.

641

I guess...

642

Why don't we just show them right here?

643

Here's your little beauty secret.

644

<i>I guess I just try to be myself.</i>

645

<i>To be sincere</i>

646

<i>and grateful for all that I have.</i>

647

<i>And to always remember
to lead with my heart.</i>

648

<i>Aw, America's sweetheart.</i>

649

I just...

650

I try to be myself.

651

Stop it!

652

Stop it.

653

You're taking it from me.

654

That's your little secret.

655

Stop it!

656

Stop it, stop it, stop it.

657

You have to...

658

...control yourself!

659

I can't go back inside her.

660

Gross, old,

661

fat,

662

disgusting!

663

Coming to bed?

664

Yes.

665

I'll be right there.

666

Fuck.

667

<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hi!

668

Hi, this is an emergency.

669

There's no more stabilizer fluid.

670

Hello?

671

It's fucking 503.

672

<i>Yes.</i>

673

I'm telling you, this is urgent.
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

674

<i>It means
you've reached the end.</i>

675

What do you mean, the end?

676

<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

677

<i>If you want more,</i>

678

<i>you must let the fluid regenerate.</i>

679

Tell me how to do it,

680

I need to stabilize myself right now.

681

<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

682

Excuse me?

683

<i>The switch reboots
the fluid secretion process</i>

684

<i>so you can continue
to enjoy the experience.</i>

685

No, no, no.

686

I can't switch, I can't.

687

Especially not now.

688

<i>There is no other option.</i>

689

Sue?

690

Babe?

691

Sue?

692

You alright?

693

Stressed out about tomorrow?

694

Babe?

695

Babe.

696

Sue? Is something wrong?

697

You a little cranky because
of your lady business?

698

Sue, open the door.

699

<i>Come on, Sue.</i>

700

<i>It's not funny, I need to take a piss.</i>

701

<i>Sue, open the door.</i>

702

<i>Open the door, Sue. Come on.</i>

703

<i>Babe.</i>

704

<i>Open the door.</i>

705

<i>Sue...</i>

706

<i>Open the door!</i>

707

Get out!

708

What the fuck?

709

Get the fuck out!

710

Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

711

And leave me alone!

712

What the fuck!

713

<i>Yes?</i>

714

I...

715

It's 503,

716

and I want to stop.

717

<i>Are you sure?</i>

718

<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

719

I wanna stop!

720

I wanna fucking stop.

721

I wanna stop!

722

<i>We'll deliver.</i>

723

Sue? I...

724

Fuck off!

725

<i>Are you sure?</i>

726

<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

727

<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

728

<i>Just on your own.</i>

729

<i>Just on your own.</i>

730

<i>On your own...</i>

731

Shut the fuck up!

732

<i>On your...</i>

733

<i>Elisabeth!</i>

734

<i>We love you!</i>

735

<i>Over here!</i>

736

<i>We love you!</i>

737

I can't.

738

I can't.

739

I can't do this.

740

I need you.

741

Cause...

742

I hate myself.

743

You gotta...
you gotta get ready,

744

it's our big, it's our big night.

745

Come on, they're gonna
love you so much.

746

Come on.

747

Come on.

748

One, two...

749

you're the only lovable part of me,

750

you have to come back.

751

You have to come back!

752

Come back...

753

Come on.

754

Come on.

755

Come on!

756

[Soft, uneasy violin music;
synth beat

757

Got an hour and a half
for makeup. Hair...

758

And then we gotta get you
to the fitting room, into your dress.

759

After that we have one final test
on stage for lighting and sound.

760

We have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

761

You got it?

762

Okay, let's go.

763

Come on.

764

The dress.

765

Wonderful!

766

Perfect!

767

And here you go...

768

Good.

769

Can we get the dance light?

770

I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

771

<i>Sue, they need to see you on stage
to set the lights.</i>

772

Huh?

773

<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

774

<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

775

<i>More beautiful,</i>

776

<i>more perfect...</i>

777

<i>Sue?</i>

778

Yes, let me meet you there.

779

<i>Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.</i>

780

Oh! Sue!

781

Sue?

782

Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

783

They have been dying to meet you.

784

Is everything...

785

okay?

786

So, smile!

787

It's what we want tonight!

788

Pretty girls should always smile.

789

Girls, come on.

790

Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

791

Come on, we gotta go.

792

Tiffany, Cindy, Ashley.

793

Go, go, go!

794

Feathers! Feathers! Feathers!

795

Hey, ready for tonight?

796

I need a better version of myself.

797

Please give me
a better version of myself, please.

798

Please!

799

Come on!

800

Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

801

<i>Please say your name,</i>

802

<i>age, measurements.</i>

803

I'm...

804

I'm...

805

<i>Pretty girls</i>

806

<i>should always smile.</i>

807

At last, we were starting to worry.
Hurry up, you're up in five.

808

There she is, so beautiful.

809

We love you!

810

This is where you belong,

811

and you'll always belong here.

812

We can't do it without you.

813

We could never do it without you.

814

You're irreplaceable.

815

Girls, come on, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

816

Alright, come on, everybody.

817

Let's go, let's go.

818

You will not be disappointed.

819

She's my most beautiful creation.

820

I have shaped her for success.

821

Five!

822

Four!

823

Three!

824

Two!

825

One!

826

I'm so happy
to be with you tonight.

827

I've missed you all

828

so much!

829

The monster!

830

Shoot the monster!

831

It's a freak!

832

No!

833

Shoot the monster!

834

Don't be scared!

835

Monster!

836

It's still me!

837

It's me!

838

I'm Elisabeth! I'm Sue!

839

Freak!

840

You freak!

841

Monster!

842

Freak!

843

Monster!

844

It's me!

845

Just me.

846

<i>Too bad her boobs aren't
in the middle of her face</i>

847

<i>instead of that nose.</i>

848

Mm-hmm.

849

<i>Next!</i>

850

<i>Pretty girls should always smile.</i>

851

<i>At 50 it stops.</i>

852

<i>So beautiful!</i>

853

<i>We love you!</i>

854

<i>You're irreplaceable!</i>
