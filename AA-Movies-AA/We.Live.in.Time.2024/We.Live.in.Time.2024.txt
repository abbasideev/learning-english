1

Good morning, ladies.

2

Hello.

3

<i>Hello!</i>

4

Thank you.

5

Mmm.

6

Babe.

7

I need a second opinion.

8

Oh. Okay.

9

What is it?

10

Um,
it's a Douglas fir parfait.

11

Oh.

12

- Darling, what time is it?
- Please.

13

Please can you just try it?

14

Hmm.

15

Okay.

16

So no gush or trickle or fluid

17

or unusual amount of dampness
in your underwear?

18

- Uh-uh.
- Mucus plug?

19

Who even are you?

20

Erm, okay.

21

Fluids?

22

Didn't you just ask me
that question?

23

- No, to drink. Have you...
- No, nothing.

24

Jesus.

25

Make sure you keep drinking.

26

Okay.

27

So as and when you, erm...
You have any...

28

Yeah, you'll be
the first to know.

29

Good to go on that.

30

Just a little more.

31

- Table five.
- Yes, Chef.

32

Sauce?

33

Right,
that's ready for service.

34

Don't look so terrified, Chef.

35

- That's fucking majestic.
- Thank you, Chef.

36

Chef?

37

Do you need anything?

38

No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

39

Leave me alone.
Go back to your station.

40

<i>So what happens now?</i>

41

I'm going to recommend

42

starting with a course
of chemotherapy.

43

Why not just remove it?

44

Sorry, I mean, why...
Why can't we just operate?

45

- Honestly?
- Yeah.

46

It's too big.

47

The first thing
we have to do is shrink it.

48

Slow it down.

49

Once we achieve that,
then we can operate.

50

And then... And then what?

51

Once you recover from surgery,

52

you'll need to complete

53

another course
of chemotherapy.

54

We really don't want to be
leaving anything behind here.

55

Hmm.

56

Given this is a reoccurrence,

57

we need an aggressive
treatment plan.

58

Okay.

59

So...

60

Just to check that I...
It would go...

61

- A course of chemotherapy...
- Mmm-hmm.

62

...followed by surgery,

63

followed by another,
hopefully final...

64

- course of chemotherapy?
- Correct.

65

Okay, great.

66

And what about work?

67

What about work?

68

Well, how much time off,
do you think,

69

realistically,
we should be considering?

70

What do you think?

71

Well, given the physical
nature of your profession,

72

honestly, if you
and your colleagues

73

can find a workable solution,

74

I would advocate
stepping back.

75

Maybe it's time
to finally get a dog.

76

I read somewhere
that pets, dogs,

77

are really good for children,

78

helping them
to cope with, like,

79

big, life stuff.

80

Hmm.

81

Because once they've gone
through the death of a pet,

82

their ability

83

to handle all the other
terrible shit goes up.

84

So...

85

So you think
we should procure a dog

86

in order to end its life
prematurely as a way of...

87

I'm obviously not suggesting
we kill a dog.

88

Maybe just a really old one.

89

What...

90

What would you say
if I said to you...

91

Erm, I'm not sure...

92

I know how to go through
all of that all over again?

93

- Erm...
- 'Cos let's...

94

Let's just say...

95

Let's just say it goes to plan

96

and...

97

In whatever it is,
like, six to eight months...

98

Mmm-hmm.

99

...I receive the all-clear
and it's great

100

and all of a sudden,

101

it feels, like, great.

102

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

103

That'd be great. Agreed, yeah.

104

But what happens
if it doesn't?

105

All of a sudden
you're in this weird position

106

where instead of making
the most out of those...

107

six, seven, eight,
maybe nine months,

108

you're gonna realise that
all you did was go bald

109

and puke your guts up.

110

Mmm-hmm.

111

Okay. Yeah.

112

So you're saying that
in that scenario,

113

for you it would be...

114

Erm, more
about quality than quantity?

115

I'm saying I'm not
particularly interested

116

in a treatment plan

117

that accidentally
wastes our time.

118

I'm saying,
in that particular scenario,

119

I'd much rather we...

120

We have six fucking amazing,
fantastic, proactive months...

121

Than 12 really,
really shitty passive ones.

122

I'm not saying I don't want
to do the treatment.

123

I'm just saying...

124

I want it to be
the right choice.

125

Knock, knock.

126

- Breakfast. You got time?
- Yeah.

127

Kumquats or eggs?

128

Mmm.

129

You tell me.

130

Then dealer's choice it is.

131

- Nice threads, by the way.
- Oh.

132

Thanks, Dad.

133

<i>Hello,
my name is Tobias Durand.</i>

134

And I'm part of
the Weetabix IT team,

135

fulfilling the role
of Master Data Steward.

136

Fabulous.

137

If you could just go ahead
and tell me

138

what you had for breakfast
this morning.

139

Honeyed kumquats on toast.

140

Followed by
a bowl of Weetabix.

141

Okey-dokey.

142

<i>I think the thing
that I enjoy most</i>

143

<i>about working here at Weetabix</i>

144

<i>is the feeling of family.</i>

145

<i>Despite the fact
that we're all of us</i>

146

<i>part of a very large,
global brand,</i>

147

<i>there's...</i>

148

There's still
a real family feeling.

149

Okay.

150

Okay.

151

Divorce.

152

<i>Patient number 14.</i>

153

They needed the bed back.

154

What's happened
to my underwear?

155

Oh, I literally have no idea.

156

This, erm...
This was all you...

157

All you had on you.

158

The Chocolate Orange was
pronounced dead at the scene.

159

Er... Erm...

160

I'm Almut, by the way.

161

Almut?

162

Almut.

163

Tobias.

164

So sorry,
but do we know each other?

165

Oh.

166

Yeah... No. Erm...

167

Sorry. I...

168

I... I ran you over.

169

Oh.

170

<i>Patient number 17.</i>

171

Sorry.

172

It's all right.

173

Hello and welcome
to Red Wagon Diner.

174

Here at Red Wagon Diner,

175

we pride ourselves
on offering our customers

176

a taste of the classic
'50s American diner

177

here on
the great British roadside.

178

All our burgers are made
to our special recipe

179

using 100% British beef

180

and our top dollar shakes
are made

181

with real dairy ice cream
to die for.

182

What can I get you?

183

I work for Weetabix.

184

As in the breakfast cereal?

185

Mmm-hmm.

186

Well, the company...

187

Sorry. The company also own...

188

Weetos, Alpen,
Ready Brek. But, yeah.

189

Wow.

190

You must be really regular.

191

Ow, ow.

192

Um, how... How about yourself?

193

I'm a chef/restaurant owner.

194

Oh.

195

Er, what kind of cuisine
do you, er...

196

...do?

197

Er, modern European takes
on classic Alpine dishes.

198

So, basically, Anglo-Bavarian.

199

Well, that's the plan, anyway.

200

Supposed to open
in a few weeks.

201

How's it going?

202

Er...

203

Oh.

204

Oh, no.

205

No, it's going fine.

206

It's gonna be great.

207

You should come.

208

No, honestly, I feel like
that's the least I could do.

209

- Oh.
- And your wife too.

210

- Darling?
- Yeah?

211

Yeah.

212

There is something

213

that your daddy and I...

214

Something that
mommy and me want to...

215

We want to talk to you about.

216

Yeah.
Something a little...

217

A little bit important, actually.

218

- It's a bit serious, though.
- Yeah.

219

Yeah, a bit serious

220

- and a bit grown-up.
- Yeah.

221

A bit serious, a bit grown-up,
a bit important.

222

Yeah.

223

So mommy didn't realize it

224

but mommy's...

225

mommy's actually
been feeling quite ill.

226

Got a bit of a tummy ache,

227

kind of a pretty nasty
tummy ache.

228

And the doctors
have basically said...

229

Hi, there! What a delicious
looking ice cream sundae.

230

Yummo!

231

My name's Noel.
What's your name?

232

Ella, and I'm three.

233

So sorry, we're actually
in the middle...

234

How would you like
to see me make

235

this entire bottle disappear?

236

- Yes, please.
- Noel? Noel, seriously.

237

- We can't do this right now.
- This is not a good time.

238

Will you help me say
the magic words?

239

Noel!

240

Go... Go away. Go away.

241

Sorry, it's just not the time.

242

So...

243

Where were we?

244

Mmm-hmm!

245

That's too much tea.

246

Can I make you one?

247

<i>All right, you two.</i>

248

It's bath time and
it's bedtime for both of you.

249

No.

250

Am I gonna have to come
and get you?

251

- No.
- Are you nodding?

252

- I'm gonna come and get you!
- Grab Teddy.

253

What are we gonna do?
Do you want me to...

254

- Oh, I don't know if I can...
- Oh!

255

- Sorry, mommy.
- No!

256

You tricked me!

257

We're going
all the way. We're going...

258

I like her best.

259

- Yep.
- Yeah.

260

- And I like her best.
- I know you do.

261

She has great hair,
doesn't she?

262

You were really great with her
this afternoon, by the way.

263

Yeah, well...

264

Yeah, I'm... I'm glad
we decided just to talk to her

265

instead of killing a dog.

266

Yeah.

267

So...

268

I was thinking...

269

Maybe, erm,

270

we...

271

Should have some sex

272

before my treatment begins.

273

Now?

274

Mmm-hmm.

285

I meant to say,

286

I got the weirdest message
from Simon.

287

You know,
Simon Maxson, my old boss?

288

Well, he, erm...

289

He wanted to know if I...

290

If I was interested in trying
out for the Bocuse d'Or.

291

As soon as all this is over,

292

we're... We're gonna make sure
that you have

293

the opportunity and the time

294

to take on whatever it is
you want.

295

But I really...

296

I really think that right now
we ought to just slow down

297

- and focus on get...
- Relax.

298

I said no.

299

Just thought
it was interesting,

300

that's all.

301

Yes!

302

Come on.

303

That was perfect!

304

That's a perfect throw.

305

<i>Thank you for joining us</i>

306

<i>in the countdown to our
New Year's Eve celebrations.</i>

307

<i>What are you up to tonight?
Are you going out...</i>

308

- Oh!
<i>- ...to watch some fireworks?</i>

309

<i>- Staying in with the kids?</i>
- Mmm.

310

<i>Have you got friends
coming round?</i>

311

- Mmm!
<i>- Ring in and let us know</i>

312

<i>- what you're planning to do...</i>
- Thank you.

313

Mmm!

314

Oh, fuck! Mmm, motherfucker!

315

Oh!

316

They're definitely getting
stronger, you know.

317

Mmm.

318

Lasting a minimum now
of 60 seconds

319

every five to ten minutes.

320

Great. Thank you.

321

See you very soon.

322

That's fine.

323

- That's fine.
- Yeah?

324

Yeah. Yeah.

325

Mmm, hang on a second.
Hang on.

326

Ooh. Yeah, yeah,
take a moment.

327

Take a beat, take a beat.

328

Okay.

329

Ready?

330

Okay.

331

Here we go.

332

Sorry.

333

Shit. I'm sorry.

334

I'm fine to walk.
Honestly. Honestly.

335

- Fuck. I'm so sorry.
- Honestly.

336

Fucking fuckface!

337

Oh, this is ridiculous!

338

Very sorry. Sorry.

339

Oh, fuck!

340

I'm sorry.
Okay, okay. You okay?

341

Yeah.

342

That's it. Well done.
You're doing a great job.

343

Yes, you are.

344

Okay.

345

Well, good news is,
mom and Dad,

346

the baby's heart rate
is all good.

347

mom, same goes
for your BP and pulse.

348

Bad news, I'm afraid, mom,

349

is that you're still
only two centimetres,

350

if that.

351

So, I'm sorry,
but you're going to have

352

to go back home again
and wait.

353

I'm sorry.

354

You wanted
to see me, Chef?

355

I did, yeah. Please.

356

Er, actually, would you...

357

Would you mind
closing the door?

358

- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Wait, sorry. No, no. Sorry.

359

- My fault.
- Oh.

360

Chef, is this about the thing
with the scallops?

361

What? No, no.

362

- Oh.
- No.

363

Tell me something, Chef.

364

What... What do
you know about the...

365

Do you need the room?

366

'Fraid so.

367

What do you know about
the Bocuse d'Or?

368

Erm, I mean,
it's like the...

369

The culinary Olympics.

370

There is no higher accolade.

371

Sorry, Chef. We are running
low on celeriac.

372

Strictly between us, Chef,

373

and I mean that,
not a word to another soul,

374

I, erm...

375

I've been asked if I would
like to compete this year

376

to represent the UK, and I...

377

I'd like you to be my commis.

378

- What?
- But listen.

379

Holy shit, Chef!

380

We have two heats
to get through.

381

And you seriously really need
to consider...

382

- Chef, I'm in!
- Time. Time, Chef.

383

You really need
to think about time.

384

Chef, it's literally
the easiest...

385

If we make it
to the European heat,

386

that is three to four days
a week minimum, training wise.

387

Make it to the final,
that is five days a week.

388

- Five days, full time.
- Chef, I'm in.

389

- And there'll be no let-up.
- I'm in. 100%.

390

Let's get out of here.

391

Mmm-hmm.

392

Yeah, I'm probably gonna have
to wet-shave you back here.

393

It's looking a little furry.

394

Really?

395

- Oh.
- Lovely.

396

Yeah, that's the ticket.

397

I'm jealous. You realize that?

398

Jay Rayner
just published a rave.

399

Okay.

400

- Okay.
- Go on.

401

- You'll be fine.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

402

Hi. How are you doing
this evening?

403

Do you have a reservation
with us?

404

Er, yeah. Tobi...
Tobias Durand. I don't...

405

Oh, my God. Mr. Weetabix.

406

This is so great.

407

How's the arm? Poor thing.

408

Oh.

409

- Yeah.
- Well, listen.

410

We're so excited to have you
with us this evening.

411

We're gonna make sure you have
the time of your life.

412

I have you down
as a table for two, correct?

413

Erm, no.

414

Sorry, that's my fault.

415

Just me in the end.

416

Oh, don't apologize.

417

- Follow me.
- Okay.

418

I'll let Chef know
you're here.

419

A little something
to get you started.

420

Oh.

421

Weisswurst amuse-bouche.

422

AKA Bavarian white sausage
with a modern twist.

423

On top, we have for you
a lemon mustard gel. Enjoy.

424

Thank you. Thank you.

425

- Hi.
- Hi.

426

Marks out of 10
for my tiny sausage?

427

It's 10.

428

I'm sorry to hear
your wife couldn't make it.

429

Is everything all right?

430

Erm, we're actually
not, erm...

431

Well, I mean...

432

Technically speaking, we still
are but legally speaking...

433

we're also...

434

Divorced.

435

Mmm.

436

The back of your neck
is so smooth.

437

My dad shaved it for me.

438

Oh, is he some kind of barber?

439

- Architect.
- Mmm.

440

Oh, how is the neck,
by the way?

441

Yeah, it's, erm, get...
Getting there.

442

I don't think
I've ever had the pleasure

443

of sleeping with an invalid
before.

444

Erm...

445

What?

446

I suppose I'm a bit, erm,
out of practice.

447

I'm also just
suddenly aware I...

448

I don't... I don't have any
kind of prophylactic on me.

449

Such low expectations.

450

Also,
by the way, erm...

451

My staff are desperate to know
if you get free Weetabix.

452

Well...

453

I can confirm to you

454

that on occasion,

455

I do have access

456

to complementary
Weetabix, yeah.

457

- Morning.
- Oh, er...

458

Adrienne Duvall.

459

We worked together
back in the day.

460

Oh.

461

And it made me realise,
well...

462

Quite so competitive?

463

I probably ought
to get going.

464

Why?

465

Who says?

466

I don't know.

467

Er, you're right.
I don't know why I said that.

468

I mean, unless you have
shit to do, then...

469

I have nothing.

470

But if you...

471

I mean, have shit to do,
then, you know...

472

I have nothing.

473

Thank you.

474

Hello.
How are you doing?

475

- Good, thank you.
- Hi.

476

Right, tasting time.

477

Are you a cheese person?

478

Mmm.

479

Do you like tapenade?

480

Okay, I'll... Thank you.

481

- Can I get these, please?
- Of course.

482

- And do you want a coffee?
- Sure, yeah.

483

Actually, that's not true.

484

A lot of it was
decidedly unhappy.

485

We were starting to maybe
think about children.

486

Then she got a position

487

in Sweden, which was...

488

Great for her.

489

So then we discussed it
and then we tried it,

490

me here, her there,

491

both of us going back
and forth depending.

492

And then eventually,
she just said, oh,

493

she didn't want to do that
any more.

494

I'm sorry.

495

Adrienne really wanted us

496

to start thinking
about family.

497

What did... What did you want?

498

Erm, I...

499

I guess there's a world
where...

500

Kids aren't really my thing.

501

Come on.

502

I'm gonna make you

503

the tastiest eggs
of your life.

504

Right.

505

Do you know the best way
to crack an egg?

506

Always on a flat surface.

507

What's the thinking
behind the two bowls?

508

Practically speaking,

509

it's much easier
to fish out a broken shell

510

from the one egg

511

rather than fishing it out
from eight eggs.

512

Mmm.

513

The versatility of the egg
knows no bounds.

514

Oh.

515

You said something to me,
erm...

516

Couple weeks ago.

517

You said... You said kids
aren't really your thing.

518

That's fine. I mean, no.

519

Of course, it...
Of course it is. Just, erm...

520

Truthfully, kids kind of
might be, maybe, or...

521

Are my thing.

522

And, erm...

523

At least I think
they might be, anyway.

524

And I... I hate...

525

Hate to even
have to, erm...

526

It's just diff...
It's just different, isn't it?

527

You know,
meeting someone at our age.

528

Whether we like it or not,

529

the clock is ticking.

530

I'm sorry,
but what the actual fuck

531

are you even talking about
right now?

532

Well...

533

It would seem to me preferable

534

to have a moderately-awkward
conversation right now

535

rather than a completely
destructive one

536

in five to ten years' time.

537

Firstly, I'm thirty-four,
not fifty-fucking-five,

538

so how about
we ease the fuck up on...

539

On the whole biological clock
bullshit thing?

540

And secondly,

541

I don't know, I'm, like,
"Back the fuck off."

542

And calm the fuck down.

543

What... What...
What's the rush?

544

Because I'm worried

545

that's there's a very distinct
and real possibility

546

that I am about
to fall in love with you.

547

I'm sorry,
I'm just not someone

548

who's interested in making
that kind of a promise.

549

And in fact, there's this
little bit of me that thinks,

550

"Fuck you" for even asking.

551

Hi.

552

How was work?

553

Er...

554

Yeah.

555

- How was bedtime?
- Yeah. It was fine.

556

We read <i>Julian Is A Mermaid.</i>

557

A lot.

558

So...

559

You know,
the day of your diagnosis,

560

you said something to me.

561

You said that
you would rather have

562

six fucking fantastic months
than 12...

563

Than 12 really shitty,
passive ones.

564

Yeah, passive ones.

565

At that time,
I was guilty of having

566

no coherent
or cohesive response

567

but what you said has really,
really stayed with me.

568

And I now do have a response

569

that I would like
to share with you.

570

Okay.

571

Okay.

572

Erm...

573

I'm sorry.

574

"Although...

575

"Although in the past,

576

- "you have..."
- Mmm.

577

Erm...

578

- What the...
- It's all right.

579

Take your time.

580

- I'm nervous.
- It's okay.

581

Erm...

582

"Although...

583

"Although in the past,
you have, erm..."

584

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Shall I...

585

I'm sorry.

586

Here.

587

Fuck it. Let's do it.

588

Yeah, let's do it.

589

- That too much?
- Yes.

590

In for a heteronormative
penny, in for a pound.

Apologies for the, erm...

Interruption?

612

I saw you the o...
The o... Last week,

613

I was passing
by the restaurant.

614

Erm...

615

And it made me realize,
well...

616

...two things.

617

First of which, I was still
quite angry with you

618

because although I might have
been somewhat insensitive,

619

you were rude to me,
which, yeah, a lot, hurt.

620

And the second thing,

621

I was guilty of
focusing on the wrong,

622

erm...

623

...thing, aspect.

624

Looking ahead
instead of right...

625

In front of me, at you.

626

I knew he was gonna do that.

627

So are you gonna catch
mommy's hair?

628

Perfect, yeah.
Open your little box.

629

Yeah.

630

Aw, that felt like a good one.

631

- Oh, yeah. Nice and clean.
- That sounded like...

632

- That's perfect!
- It's nice and...

633

That's it.

634

How much hair
do you wanna keep, mommy?

635

Yeah. Yeah, I got you.

636

- We're getting chunky now.
- Yeah, just do it.

637

- We're getting chunky.
- Oh, amazing.

638

Pat it down, Ells.

639

Good girl.

640

Hold that up there for me,
darling. Thank you.

641

- Well done, girly.
- Oh.

642

- Oh, lovely.
- Really nice.

643

- Really nice?
- Really nice.

644

Whoa, okay.

645

Wow. Wow. Mmm.

646

Ooh, ooh.

647

- Aw.
- Aw.

648

You look beautiful.

649

Doesn't she look
so beautiful?

650

Sorry.

651

- Yes?
- Happy?

652

Yes.

653

Anywhere from
200 to 600 seated guests,

654

access to over four acres
of private gardens.

655

Wow.

656

Along with its own
secure car-parking area.

657

- Marble flooring.
- Wow.

658

Roman nobles.

659

Around about 120 guests,

660

expanding to around about 140
for your evening reception.

661

And the great hall is licensed
for music and entertainment.

662

Hear that, Ells?

663

- Ooh.
- Dancing.

664

Our conservatory
is licensed for

665

up to and including
160 guests...

672

Though I should add
that the use of drones

673

is strictly prohibited.

674

This one's going
to take 20 minutes,

675

give or take, then we'll flush
out the system

676

and get you started
on number two.

677

Okay, thank you.

678

Right. Give us a shout
if you need anything.

679

Will do.

680

Chefs,
how are we all doing?

681

Sorry to keep you waiting.

682

Technical bullshit.

683

Apologies, everyone,
for the delay.

684

Good news is, audience is in,
ready and raring.

685

So, er, just a little heads-up
from me.

686

Erm, I'll kick things off,
a little intro,

687

little bit about me,

688

little bit about my role as
Bocuse d'Or UK head coach.

689

Overview of the rules,
what's up for grabs today,

690

place at the European
semi-finals,

691

so on and so forth.

692

General frenzy-whipping.

693

Excitement. Good.

694

Any questions? Excellent.

695

All right, Chefs. Onwards.

696

- Hello, you.
- Hi! Hello.

697

- Good to see ya.
- Yeah.

698

- Congrats on the star.
- Same to you.

699

Yeah, well, I think

700

I'm a little
old hat at this point.

701

No.

702

This is Jade Khadime,
my commis.

703

- And the real deal.
- Hello, Jade.

704

Well, best of luck out there.

705

Excellent hair, by the way.

706

- Oh, thank you.
- Yes.

707

Er, just gonna pop to the loo.

708

Oh, fuck!

709

Chef!

710

Chef, they're ready for us.

711

It's fine, honestly.
Honestly, I'm fine.

712

I'm... I'm... I'm coming.

713

Chef, are you using?

714

What?

715

Chefs' circle of trust, Chef.

716

No.

717

No, I have stage three
ovarian cancer.

718

Do you want to call time
on the whole competing thing?

719

No, I do not.

720

Thank you.

721

Let's do it.

722

That's okay.
Is that right?

723

- Yeah, it's fine.
- That's brilliant.

724

All right.

725

Best of luck
out there, everyone.

Hi.

Penny for your thoughts.

I think I like this one

either way.

733

Could I sleep on it?

734

Yeah.

735

Yeah, absolutely.

Sorry I haven't

It's okay.
You brought me a baby.

753

- I brought you a baby.
- Ben, how are you?

754

Oh, sorry, babies.

755

Babies want attention. Hi, hi.

756

- Unbelievable.
- Hi, loves. Come on in.

757

- Wow!
- Thank you. Wow!

758

- It goes back so far.
- I know, and I have a bath.

759

- And a double bed.
- Ah, hi.

760

Go on.

761

- You've never been here.
- Really, so grown-up.

762

Have you? I've just realized.

763

- It's so cool.
- No, I haven't. No.

764

My goodness.
Look at the little...

765

Hi!
Sorry, didn't mean to, er...

766

- Hi, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.

767

- Hello.
- Good to see you.

768

- I'm Almut's sister, Leah.
- I'm Reginald.

769

- That's my dad, yeah.
- Lovely to meet you.

770

Reginald,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

771

- It smells amazing.
- Thank you.

772

- Likewise.
- Hi, I'm Almut's brother,

773

- Lucas.
- Welcome, welcome.

774

Thank you, thank you.

775

Well, it's not my home, but
I'm welcoming everyone anyway.

776

Hey, I'm the other brother,
Ben.

777

- Hi. Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

778

You too.

779

- Thanks for this.
- Oh, pleasure.

780

Bea said we had to go
to Salt Lake.

781

She said, "You'll love it,"
she says.

782

And so... And so we're there
and it's winter.

783

It's... It's snowing.

784

It's beautiful and, erm,

785

we decide to visit
the Tabernacle.

786

- I don't know if you know it.
- Oh, yeah.

787

It's, erm...

788

Well, I don't even
know how late

789

and, er,
we've watched the sun go down.

790

And it's been the most...

791

You know,

792

the most wonderful day
of our entire fucking lives.

793

And I turned to her
and I said... I say...

794

"Bea, don't know about you,

795

"but I think this is how

796

"I'd like to spend
the rest of my life."

797

No ring, nothing, just...

798

- Said it.
- And what did she say?

799

"Don't be
so fucking sentimental."

800

"I don't need a roomful of
people and a piece of paper

801

"to know I want to spend
the rest of my life with you,"

802

- she said.
- Yeah.

803

- Amen.
- Yeah.

804

So when were you... When were
you all in Salt Lake?

805

Erm, 15 years ago.

806

- Give or take.
- Business or pleasure?

807

What? What's going on?

808

I... I just happened to be in
a competition that year, so...

809

Happened, just...

810

- Don't.
- Competition?

811

What sort of a competition?

812

It was, erm...

813

I used to...
I used to figure-skate.

814

Erm... ISU World
Championships.

815

She was unbe-fucking-lievable.

816

I can't believe you haven't
told these guys this.

817

- Stop.
- It was, it was.

818

- Check it out.
- No.

819

- Check it out.
- You have to see this,

820

- Reginald, it's...
- I'm speechless.

821

- ...absolutely remarkable.
- Here she goes.

822

Here she goes. Here she goes.

823

Oh!

824

- This is you?
- Yeah, watch this.

825

Oh!

826

Oh, my goodness me.

827

Stop. Stop, stop.
Please. I said no.

828

I said no.

829

- You should be proud.
- Yeah, bloody marvelous.

830

Thanks, mom.

831

Yeah.

832

Wine. Anyone for any wine?

833

You know
it isn't even just you?

834

Like, honest to God,
no one knows about it.

835

Thank you.

836

It was Dad
who got me into skating.

837

I think he actually really
wanted a sporty child and...

838

And I suppose
I was his last chance.

839

And I guess...

840

He was right to push me

841

because it turned out
I fucking loved it

842

and I was really good at it.

843

And in the beginning,
he would drive me to Swindon

844

virtually every weekend.

845

Hmm.

846

And then when he was ill,
when he was sick, I...

847

I wanted to help out and...

848

I took some time off from it.

849

And then...

850

After that,

851

skating without him around
was just joyless.

852

So you just stopped?

853

I think it just really
reminded me of him.

854

You okay?

855

- What?
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

856

Okay.

857

Whoa, whoa. Okay.

858

I'm cautiously optimistic

859

we're dealing with
an infection.

860

But, listen,
once the fluid is out,

861

we're gonna run some tests,

862

and if we find anything,
you'll be the first to know.

863

- Okay.
- In the meantime,

864

I'd like to get you started
with some antibiotics,

865

just to help with the pain.

866

- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

867

- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

868

- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

869

<i>Tobias, I had a call
from the hospital.</i>

870

They called to see if I could
come in, and so I did.

871

Speaking.

872

They said
it wasn't an infection.

873

What is it?

874

What is it?

875

I've made notes.

876

Erm,

877

they are recommending

878

either a partial
or a full-blown hysterectomy.

879

Your note-taking is incredibly
thorough, by the way.

880

Every cloud...

881

All right,
so let me just check, I...

882

- Mmm-hmm.
- Option One would be...

883

If we ever want
to conceive naturally...

884

Freeze embryos.

885

Mmm.

886

- Followed by...
- Surgery.

887

So removing one ovary,
not both.

888

- Followed by...
- Chemo. Shit.

889

Shit ton of chemo.

890

- Followed by...
- Shagging.

891

Or, well, yeah, whatever. IVF.

892

Oh, I...
I vote shagging, but okay.

893

Alternatively, Option Two.

894

Way more invasive
but way lower risk of relapse.

895

Ovaries and uterus,
they take it.

896

They take it all.

897

Okay.

898

Okay.

899

- I think...
- Listen... Oh, sorry.

900

- No. Do you want...
- No. No, you.

901

Okay.

902

I guess...

903

I think,
unless you think I'm...

904

Insane, I think I am inclined

905

to say that I would...

906

I would like to hang on
to at least one of my...

907

Fucking addled
cancer-ridden ovaries.

908

Because, well...

909

Just because I never,
in a general sense,

910

saw myself having kids,

911

doesn't mean
that there isn't a world

912

where I couldn't see myself,
in time,

913

deciding to have them
with you.

914

I'm in remission.

915

<i>We should do something
to celebrate.</i>

916

Come on! Come on!

917

- ...the throne or something.
- What?

918

No.

919

That serves you right.

920

- Everything's great!
- Everything's fine.

921

Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

922

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

923

<i>Breathe in.</i>

924

<i>Breathe out.</i>

925

Ooh.

926

<i>Breathe in.</i>

927

One second.

928

Oh, fuck me.

929

<i>Feeling relaxed and calm.</i>

930

Almut?

931

Al? Almut?

932

Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

933

Oh.

934

I'm gonna get a drink.

935

That is...
Yes, £20 with the fuel.

936

Thank you. Cheers.

937

Thank you.

938

Hiya.

939

Oh, shit.

940

- Sorry. Thank you.
- Hiya.

941

- Hi, how are you?
- Yeah, good, thank you.

942

- There you go. Any fuel?
- Er, no.

943

Sorry.

Al?

945

Al? Al?

946

Sorry. One second, sorry.

947

Al?

948

- Mmm-hmm?
- Hi. Everything okay?

949

Hmm. Kind of.

950

- What?
- Erm...

951

Well, you see, I thought...
I thought I needed a poo.

952

- Yeah.
- And, er,

953

- now that I'm in here...
- Yeah?

954

...I think
I might need to push.

955

No. No, no. No, no.

956

No! Okay?

957

Sorry, but you can't push.

958

If you let me in, I can...
I can help.

959

We have biscuits now, Al.
We have biscuits, okay?

960

- Okay.
- Okay, come on. Let me in.

961

Oh, no, I can't.

962

What? Just un...
Unlock it and open it.

963

I can't. It's not happening.
It's not... It's not working.

964

Wait.

965

Sorry. I'm sorry. My, erm...

966

My partner is stuck
in the, erm...

967

Do you have the... For the...
The key for the...

968

- Yeah.
- So sorry, er...

969

- Thank you.
- Hey, Jane, I'll just...

970

Okay, Al, we have the key.
We have the key, don't worry.

971

It's okay. Sorry about this.

972

- No, no, it's fine.
- Thank you very much.

973

Okay.

974

Okay, just...
Just don't push, Al.

975

Whatever you do,
just don't pu...

976

Erm, it's just...
Got broken off.

977

Erm...

978

- So, Al?
- Yeah?

979

I'm gonna need you
to stand back, okay?

980

- What?
- Standing... Standing back

981

- away from the door.
- Wait, wait, wait. Why?

982

All the way back.
Right the way back. All right?

983

- Why?
- I'm so, so sorry.

984

I think she might be
about to give birth.

985

- Yeah, erm...
- Maybe...

986

I'll... I'll... I'm gonna get
Jane, 'cause she'll know...

987

Okay, get Jane.
Jane? Jane?

988

Jane, pregnant lady
stuck in the khazi.

989

- Just bear with me.
- Fine.

990

The key snapped in the...

991

- How many weeks?
- Forty.

992

Huh. Mazel tov.

993

Okay.

994

Keep standing back, Al.

995

- Shall I have a go?
- Yeah, yeah.

996

No, it's not. Nah.

997

Okay. Okay, Al,
still standing back?

998

Okay?

999

- Hi.
- I can't. I'm sorry.

1000

What...
What do you mean, you can't?

1001

Move. I can't. I'm sorry.

1002

I can feel it.

1003

- No.
- Mmm.

1004

- No, I know, but we can't.
- Mmm.

1005

We have to... We don't...
Not... Not here.

1006

- We... We don't... It's not...
- Mmm, listen to me.

1007

- It's not safe.
- It's just coming. It is.

1008

It is. It's coming.
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1009

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1010

I'm sorry but I... It's...
This is...

1011

It's it. It's it. It's it.

1012

Yeah, it seems like we have

1013

almost everything we need.

1014

Except for a midwife.

1015

- Except for a midwife.
- Yeah.

1016

Ooh. Ah. Ah.

1017

<i>Is that a push I hear there?</i>

1018

Yeah, I think this might...
This might be a push.

1019

- Do you wanna push?
- Yeah.

1020

- Yes, she wants to push.
- Yeah.

1021

Watch your head. Watch
your head. Watch your head.

1022

Understood, yeah.
She... She... She can push.

1023

Al, Al, I'm gonna have
to check again

1024

to see if I can see any
body parts. Is that okay?

1025

I'm not exactly in a position
to say no, am I?

1026

Okay.

1027

- Yes, I can see the head.
- Wait, what?

1028

- What? Tobias?
- Shh. Erm... Sorry.

1029

- Wait, no, I'm sorry, no.
- Tobias? Tobias?

1030

Sorry, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1031

Okay, listen to me.
You've got this.

1032

- A head?
- Sorry, sorry.

1033

I'm gonna put you on
speakerphone.

1034

Hold on one second.
Can you, can you, can you...

1035

- Dig deep, babe.
- I got it.

1036

- Thank you. Sorry, still here.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1037

Can you say
that last bit again, please?

1038

<i>With each contraction,
place the palm of your hand...</i>

1039

Listen,
you're doing brilliantly.

1040

<i>...against the vagina</i>

1041

<i>and apply firm
but gentle pressure</i>

1042

<i>- to keep baby's head...</i>
- To keep baby inside?

1043

- No.
- No, Christ!

1044

<i>- No, please do not do that.</i>
- No.

1045

<i>You do not want to keep</i>

1046

<i>- the baby inside.</i>
- Right.

1047

<i>You want to apply firm
but gentle pressure</i>

1048

<i>to keep baby's head
from delivering too fast</i>

1049

<i>and tearing.</i>

1050

Sorry. Sorry. Understood, yes.
Understood.

1051

- Oh, my God.
<i>- Do you understand?</i>

1052

Yes, yes, got it now. Sorry.

1053

<i>How is mom doing now?</i>

1054

How's mom doing now?

1055

Oh. Tell her it feels like

1056

a huge fucking lump
between my legs.

1057

She says it feels like she's
got a lump between her legs.

1058

- A huge fucking lump.
- I'm sorry.

1059

A huge fucking lump
between her legs.

1060

Yeah.

1061

<i>Is there anyone else
there with you?</i>

1062

Yeah, we're actually...
I'm sorry.

1063

I'm sorry,
I don't know their names.

1064

- Er, Sanjaya.
- Sanjaya.

1065

- Jane, hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

1066

<i>Could one of you
do me a favour</i>

1067

<i>and go and make sure...

1068

<i>...the front door is unlocked
and open?</i>

1069

Yeah. It's a...
It's a petrol station.

1070

Yeah, it's a petrol station.
You just walk straight in.

1071

Ooh, I can feel it,
I can feel it.

1072

The head, it's coming.
It's coming.

1073

Okay, here we go.

1074

Here we go.

1075

Whoa-ho!

1076

Lean into me. That's it.

1077

There's a face!
There's a face!

1078

There's a face!
I mean, a head.

1079

There's a head! It's great.

1080

Head's out.

1081

- Oh, my God!
- You're amazing.

1082

Yeah, she's doing great.
She is. She's doing great.

1083

You're doing great.
You're doing so fucking great!

1084

Oh, my God!

1085

All right, yes!

1086

Got the shoulders.
Shoulders are out.

1087

That's it.

1088

Yes. That's it. That's it.

1089

Ah. Oh. She's out.

1090

- Yes, yes! You did it!
- Oh! Oh, my God. She is?

1091

<i>That's great.
That's fantastic.</i>

1092

<i>Is baby crying, Dad?
Is baby breathing?</i>

1093

Both.

1094

- Both.
- We did it!

1095

- We did it!
- Wow!

1096

You are incredible.

1097

<i>What I need you to do now,
is get a clean towel</i>

1098

<i>and gently wipe
and dry baby off, okay, Dad?</i>

1099

- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- Nose and mouth first.</i>

1100

<i>- All right?</i>
- She's gorgeous.

1101

- Yeah, okay.
- She's gorgeous.

1102

- Can I see her?
- Yeah, she's coming.

1103

Can you put that towel
underneath for me?

1104

Can I see her?
I have to see her.

1105

- She's coming. She's coming.
- Oh, my God. There she is.

1106

Thank you, Sanjaya.

1107

- Hi.
- That's your mommy.

1108

That's your mommy.

1109

<i>I can hear her. You did say
"her", didn't you, "she"?</i>

1110

Her. She.

1111

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1112

<i>Congratulations, Mom and Dad.</i>

1113

<i>Now, I need you to make sure</i>

1114

<i>baby is wrapped in a towel,
okay?</i>

1115

- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Can you do that for me, Dad?</i>

1116

Ah.

1117

<i>Without pulling the cord
too tight,</i>

1118

<i>I want you to put baby
in mom's arms, all right?</i>

1119

Al, Al, Al.

1120

<i>And I'm gonna need you
to make sure</i>

1121

<i>that mom and baby
are kept warm, okay?</i>

1122

- Yeah.
- Hi.

1123

- I've got you.
- Yeah.

1124

Oh, my God. Hi!

1125

Oh, she's beautiful!

1126

Thanks, Jane.

1127

Shh.

1128

<i>Dad, I've got some good news.</i>

1129

<i>Ambulance should be with you
any minute now, all right?</i>

1130

Okay.

1131

<i>In the meantime, contractions
might start up again, okay...</i>

1132

Do you want the... Yeah.

1133

<i>...because mom's got
to deliver the placenta,</i>

1134

<i>so I'm going to need you to
try and keep her nice and calm</i>

1135

<i>- and warm. Okay?</i>
- Yeah.

1136

Okay, I can do that.

1137

Yeah.

1138

Happy New Year.

1139

<i>...Happy New Year...</i>

1140

Happy New Year.

1141

Happy New Year.

1142

Not only have we been
unable to shrink the tumor,

1143

but in fact the disease
seems to have metastasised.

1144

Which means, I'm afraid,

1145

we're still not in a position
to operate.

1146

But there are plenty of
reasons to remain positive.

1147

Other treatment options
are still available.

1148

Failure first time around has
almost no bearing whatsoever

1149

on the likelihood
of second-line success.

1150

It's fine. I'm fine.

1151

I'm okay. It's okay, honestly.

1152

Yeah.

1153

It's okay not to be okay.

1154

It's a lot.

1155

You've been through a lot,
both of you.

1156

Gosh. Christ.

1157

Sorry.

1158

Oh, my God. Are you sure?

1159

Not exactly haute cuisine.

1160

Thank you.

1161

Oh. Thanks.

1162

What did you go for?

1163

Twix.

1164

- Nice.
- Yeah.

1165

- What about you?
- Bounty.

1166

When in Rome.

1167

Meant to ask, erm...

1168

I have a feeling my 4:00
is gonna overrun.

1169

I don't suppose

1170

there's any chance you might
be able to do pick-up?

1171

Erm, only if
you have the time.

1172

- Definitely.
- Thank you. That'd be great.

1173

Pleasure.

1174

Okay, so that is
15 minutes over.

1175

Fuck.

1176

Sixteen.

1177

Fuck, fuck. It's fucked. Stop.

1178

It's fucked. It's... We're...

1179

We're still far
too fucking slow on the prep.

1180

And this whole
sous vide situation

1181

- is fucking killing us!
- All right. All right. Easy.

1182

Let's take five.

1183

No, I don't wanna
take a break.

1184

I don't wanna take five.
I wanna go back to the start.

1185

I need to look at the plans.
I need to look at the timings.

1186

I need to figure this shit
the fuck out.

1187

Sick of this shit!

1188

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1189

<i>Yeah, you're right.
Let's take a break.</i>

1190

<i>Let's take five.</i>

1191

Right, what's next?

1192

- Octopus?
- Yep.

1193

Where the hell were you?

1194

You said you were gonna

1195

- do pick-up.
- I was in the restaurant.

1196

- Oh, my God.
- No.

1197

You weren't in the restaurant,
cos I spoke to Skye.

1198

She didn't know where the hell
you were either.

1199

Was everything okay
with the... With the pick-up?

1200

No, not particularly.

1201

Jesus.

1202

I was this close to calling
round A&E departments.

1203

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1204

Erm...

1205

I'm in training
for the Bocuse d'Or.

1206

Hmm.

1207

- Beg your pardon?
- Not... Not the final.

1208

Just the Euros.

1209

We, erm... We won the UK heat.

1210

How long?

1211

- Huh?
- How long have you been

1212

prioritising fucking cooking
instead of getting better?

1213

Er, the UK heat
was back in October

1214

and the, er, Euro qualifiers
are coming up soon.

1215

Do... Do the hospital know?
Did they, erm...

1216

Did you... Please.

1217

Please. Please tell me that...

1218

That they, erm,
and that you...

1219

What difference does it make
if they know?

1220

Oh, grow up, will you, Almut?

1221

You have cancer.

1222

You have cancer, Al.

1223

No, you grow up,
you fucking dick.

1224

The difference
this could make is...

1225

It's vast.

1226

Why?
Why are you taking the risk?

1227

- Isn't it obvious?
- No, actually, it's not.

1228

- Not to me.
- I'm... I'm not exactly

1229

gonna get the chance again,
am I?

1230

What is that supposed to mean?
In what reality...

1231

It means I'm not
particularly interested

1232

in dying with fuck all
to show for it.

1233

Oh, okay.

1234

So we're not...
We're not enough for you?

1235

Is that...
Is that what it is?

1236

Award-winning chef

1237

cum-former
figure-skating nutcase...

1238

No, now
you're just being mean.

1239

No, no, no. No, I'm not.

1240

I'm... I'm honestly...
I'm trying to understand

1241

what it is that motivates
an otherwise perfectly sane...

1242

Of course you factor
into my thinking, you fuck!

1243

Okay, so, then,
I don't understand.

1244

I'm sorry.

1245

But, I really...
Honest to God, I don't.

1246

Maybe... I mean, Jesus!

1247

I mean,
did it ever occur to you

1248

that maybe I don't wanna just
be someone's dead fucking mom?

1249

I mean, at this point
nothing terrifies me more

1250

than the thought of having her

1251

having nothing whatsoever
to remember me by.

1252

And it's like there's this...
This bit of me

1253

that is fucking desperate
for her to know

1254

that I didn't just give up.

1255

And wouldn't it be
quite the thing

1256

if maybe one day she decided
to look back on this time,

1257

she actually chose
to look back

1258

on this entire godforsaken
episode and thought,

1259

"Wow, that's my mom"?

1260

I don't...

1261

I don't want my relationship
with Ella

1262

to be solely defined
by my decline.

1263

Or maybe
I actually just can't bear

1264

the thought
of being forgotten.

1265

I'm not sure which is worse.

1266

Wanting us to remember
your achievements

1267

is one thing.

1268

Wanting us to somehow remember
your achievements

1269

that we have absolutely
no fucking knowledge of...

1270

Okay, I get it, I fucked up.
I fucked up. Please stop.

1271

Please.
Please stop going on about it.

1272

When is it?

1273

The thing?

1274

The European qualifying,
what... Whatever?

1275

June.

1276

June?

1277

June the, erm...

1278

It's the 5th and 6th of June.

1279

Oh, right.

1280

I'm so sorry, Tobias.

1281

I am.

1282

Aerodynamic, innit?

1283

Chef, I think
I might be about to throw up.

1284

Oh, shit. Erm, do you...
Do you have a buck...

1285

Can I have a bucket?

1286

Like a cup, or...

1287

Okay, there you go.

1288

Okay.

1289

- Better?
<i>- Oui,</i> Chef.

1290

Sometimes, Chef,
inside just wants out.

1291

- Okay?
- Yeah.

1292

- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
