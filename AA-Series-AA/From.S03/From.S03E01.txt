- [Boyd] <i>Previously on</i> From...
- [crows cawing]

2

Tabby, whatever this is,
it's real,

3

and we are stuck.

4

You're telling me
I'm in a town I can't leave

5

and that every night
monsters come from the forest.

6

[Frank] No! Aah!

7

A man protects his family,
Frank!

8

- [grunts]
- Open your eyes and look!

9

Look at what you've done!
Look at them!

10

[screaming]

11

And I wish you had the luxury
of grief, but you don't, Boyd.

12

These people need you.

13

<i>You need to be the one
to lead these people home.</i>

14

[Boyd] No!

15

- [gasping]
- Stay with me!

16

They're losing their leaves...
the trees.

17

Is it bad that they're
losing their leaves?

18

Things change.
Here, it's usually bad.

19

Storm wiped out half our crop.

20

Gonna have to get real serious
about rations

21

with all the new people.

22

- [screaming]
<i>- Last night, Elgin almost</i>

23

drowned in his sleep.

24

He what?

25

Donna, I was told
I can't have kids.

26

With all you've seen, you can't
wrap your head around a miracle?

27

[Tabitha] I saw something
that wasn't there.

28

- What?
- I saw two children,

29

<i>standing in the middle
of the road, staring at me.</i>

30

The night the bad things
happened,

31

when my mother went to save the
children locked in the tower.

32

<i>- [Julie] No!
- [Ethan] Mom!</i>

33

[Tabitha] What's wrong?
Julie! Julie!

34

[continues screaming]

35

What if the only way to save
Julie is to find that tower?

36

- Tabby...
- I have to try this, Jim.

37

Please.

38

It's a Faraway tree. Here.

39

My mother said it would take her
to the tower, to the children.

40

Every time I see something
really weird, I see this symbol.

41

Tabitha told you she saw this
symbol down in the tunnels.

42

- [children groaning]
- [children] <i>Anghkooey.</i>

43

<i>If there's answers to be found,
that's where they'll be.</i>

44

[children] <i>Anghkooey!</i>

45

Everything was fine until
you went into the forest.

46

I think this is
gonna help me fix this.

47

Aah! Aah!

48

- [grunts]
- Aah!

49

It's not your fear that
feeds the forest, Boyd.

50

It's hope.

51

- [screaming]
- [Abby] Let it go, Boyd.

52

If they don't die today,
they'll just die tomorrow.

53

No.

54

Aah!

55

- [gasping, coughing]
<i>- You don't break me.</i>

56

You hear that?!
You don't fucking break me!

57

I'm sorry.
This is the only way.

58

[screaming]

59

- Where am I?
- St. Anthony's Hospital.

60

Three days ago, a pair of hikers
found you in the woods.

61

You were lying unconscious
on the side of a trail.

62

[muttering]

63

You said "St. Anthony's
Hospital," but where is this?

64

You're in Camden.

65

Maine.

66

Can you tell me your name?

67

[breathing shakily]

68

What?

69

You were found
without any identification.

70

Can you tell me anything
about what happened to you?

71

Where did you get
those cuts and bruises?

72

[telephone ringing in distance]

73

I, uh...

74

Why don't you have a seat?

75

It's okay.

76

It's all right.

77

No one's gonna hurt you.

78

Is there someone we can call?

79

A family member?

80

No.

81

Dr. Brody?

82

The police are on their way.

83

Thank you.

84

Oh, why...

85

It's just a formality.

86

We all just want to make sure
you're okay, that's all.

87

[breathing rapidly]

88

Now that you're awake, I'd also
like to run a few tests,

89

if you're feeling up to it.
Would that be all right?

90

[breathing rapidly]

91

I'm gonna step
outside for a minute,

92

but I'll be right down the hall.

93

Sit tight and rest, all right?

94

[gasping]

95

[hangers clattering]

96

[indistinct conversations

"It's the only way"?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[Father Khatri] Shouldn't
Kristi be doing that?

153

Kristi's got
other things on her mind.

154

She has to look after Marielle.

155

Right.

156

How are they, by the way...

157

Marielle, Randall, and Julie?

158

They seem fine.

159

[chuckles, scoffs]

160

What?

161

Well, the fact that you can
look at anything right now

162

and describe it as "fine"

163

has a bewildering charm to it.

164

Yeah, well,
we're still here, right?

165

One of your own people tried
to kill you three days ago.

166

Half the town is still
afraid to go to sleep,

167

you have a food shortage
with no solution,

168

I'm not sure if
you've noticed...

169

it's getting
pretty cold outside.

170

Yeah, well, we got blankets.

171

Oh, right, yeah,
I forgot about the blankets.

172

Never mind.
I guess we're fine then.

173

What do you want me to do?

174

Scream "fire"?
Get everybody panicked?

175

Maybe they aren't
panicked enough.

176

Maybe <i>you</i>
aren't panicked enough.

177

You know,
when I was in that chamber,

178

about to smash
the, uh, music box,

179

that thing that was
talking to me,

180

telling me to give up,

181

that hope is what
the forest fed on...

182

that thing, whatever it was,
it sure as hell wasn't my wife.

183

So, what are you?

184

I'm afraid I can't
answer that for you, Boyd.

185

[Ethan] Stop!

186

[Tian-Chen speaking Cantonese]

187

[Ethan]
No! Let me go!

188

[Tian-Chen speaking Cantonese]

189

[sighs]

190

[groaning]

191

[Ethan] We have to help her!
Stop! Let me go!

192

[Tian-Chen speaking Cantonese]

193

- Let me go!
- [speaking Cantonese]

194

No! Let me go!

195

- [speaking Cantonese]
- Ethan!

196

We've been looking
everywhere for you.

197

You told them, didn't you?

198

Hey, I'm talking to you.

199

[Ethan]
Why'd you tell them?

200

[sighs]

201

We have to go find Mom!

202

We can't just leave
her out there!

203

- We have to do something!
- [Jim] I know.

204

Just, uh, go inside,
all right? Just go.

205

Dad!

206

You found him.

207

Good.

208

Hey, uh...

209

Yeah, I...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

210

Julie.

211

It's not your fault, Dad.
None of this is your fault.

212

Jim?

213

Uh...

214

[exhales heavily]

215

[Boyd]
You know you can't do this.

216

I never should have let her go.
I'm not gonna just sit around.

217

Jim, you can't be
in the woods overnight.

218

My son just tried to run away so
that he could go look for her.

219

My daughter is still
refusing to talk about

220

whatever happened
to her when she, uh...

221

[sighs]
My kids need their mom.

222

What am I supposed to do?

223

I don't know.
But it can't be this.

224

I'll keep
a talisman in the tent.

225

Jim, wait. Jim!

226

Listen, I... Jim!

227

I already tried that, when
I went into the woods with Sara,

228

and our tent got dragged God
knows where by God knows what.

229

You still made it back okay.

230

Yeah, by the skin
of my goddamn teeth.

231

I'm not having
this conversation.

232

You know as well as I do that
the odds are she's already...

233

[Jim] Don't!

234

Don't you fucking dare.

235

What's goin' on?

236

I'm gonna go look for my wife.

237

All right, wait,
just hold on a second.

238

If you're gonna go, there might
be a safer way to do this.

239

[coughing]

240

[pounding on door]

241

Come on! You've been in there
almost an hour already!

242

Just give me a second.

243

You said that 15 minutes ago!
Come on!

244

[gasps]

245

[indistinct conversations]

246

I can't wait any longer!

247

[pounding on door]

248

[turns off faucet]

249

Hurry up!
What are you doing in there?

250

[pounding on door]

251

It's bad enough you're
getting double rations

252

without you hogging
the bathroom.

253

Whoa. Back off, Nicky.

254

Eat shit, Clara.

255

Hey, is there a problem?

256

Yeah, there's a problem.
I'm about to piss on the floor.

257

Screw her.

258

[door locking]

259

[Ellis] You doing okay?

260

Yeah, I'm fine.

261

Baby, you really
gotta eat something.

262

I will. I just...

263

My stomach
just hasn't been right.

264

I just gotta rest.

265

There's two of you
I gotta worry about now.

266

I'll be okay.

267

The first couple of months
can be hard, but...

268

- Yeah.
- ...she'll be all right.

269

Ellis, we've got work to do.

270

Isn't it too soon to harvest?

271

We've already lost
half our crop to the storm.

272

I don't wanna risk losing
what little we have left,

273

hoping the ground
doesn't freeze.

274

Has he slept yet?

275

[sighs] I don't know.

276

[sighs]

277

We got bigger
things to deal with.

278

Round up some bodies.
Meet me out in the field.

279

The day that Sara and I found
the lighthouse in the woods,

280

we started out
at the little stone hut

281

where I found the talismans.

282

We were also in a tent that got
dragged who knows where.

283

But if you start out
in the hut each morning,

284

you're at least starting closer
to what you're trying to find,

285

and you've got a place
to come back to at night,

286

so you don't
get yourself killed.

287

Makes sense. Thanks.

288

Uh, wait. You said you and Sara
both made camp in there?

289

Yeah. Why?

290

I'm gonna go with him.

291

Can I talk to you outside?

292

Hey. Hey!

293

[sighs]

294

Look, look, I know what
you're gonna say, okay?

295

But there's no way we can
let him go out there alone.

296

I get... I get why
you're afraid to go back...

297

- I am not afraid...
- Yes! Yes, you are,

298

and you've got a lot
of reasons to be, Boyd.

299

[sighs] But someone's
gotta make sure

300

that Jim comes back
in one piece.

301

I know what it's like
to lose a parent here,

302

and I'm not gonna
watch Julie and Ethan

303

lose both their parents
in the same week.

304

We can't play
defense forever, Boyd.

305

What the fuck?

306

What the fuck is...

307

Jade?

308

[Jade]
They tried to show me.

309

I don't see it.

310

I can't see it. I can't see it.
[muttering]

311

They tried to show me.

312

What's he talking about?

313

No idea.

314

- [Jade] I don't understand it.
- Did you know about this?

315

[Jade]
They're trying to show me.

316

I mean, I knew he was pretty
obsessed with that drawing,

317

but this is... insane.

318

I can't... I can't see it.

319

I can't... Fuck.
I can't see it.

320

Yeah, I'll get that boarded up.

321

- No.
- [Jade] I can't see it.

322

Help me take him
back to the station.

323

- He can sleep it off.
- [Jade] I can't see it.

324

- I can't...
- I'm gonna help you, buddy.

325

- No, no.
- [Boyd] No, no, no, no.

326

[Kenny] It's all right. Hey!
Let's do this.

327

- I gotta see... I gotta...
- No, no.

328

- I gotta figure this out!
- Just stand up.

329

- Ready?
- [groaning]

330

[indistinct conversations]

331

It's so cute.
It's amazing, like...

332

Look at this.

333

[girl]
Oh, that's really cute.

334

[camera clicking]

335

Let me get one of the two of us.

336

[camera shutter clicking]

337

- What's wrong?
- [Tabitha] Excuse me.

338

Hi.

339

Um, would it be possible for me
to borrow one of your phones?

340

Um, no.

341

Please.

342

- Will you be quick?
- Yeah.

343

Thank you.

344

[quietly]
Why would you do that?

345

Okay.

346

[phone line ringing]

347

[woman] <i>Hello?</i>

348

Mom?

349

351

<i>Ay, mija!</i>

Um...

355

a little while, but, um...

357

I-I just don't want
you to worry, Mom.

358

<i>No, Tabby, the police
are looking for you</i>

359

<i>and Jim and the kids.

360

I know. I know, Mom. I know.

361

- I'm... I'm so sorry.
<i>- Ay, mi amor.</i>

362

I... I... I'm gonna tell you
everything as soon as I see you.

363

<i>Please!</i> Por favor!

364

I just...

365

<i>We have been so worried!</i>

366

I just wanted to hear your voice
and for you to hear mine.

367

<i>Tabby!</i>

368

Mom, I love you so much,
and I miss you and...

369

<i>Ah, mi amor!</i>

370

Jim and I are doing everything
we can to come back home soon.

371

<i>Ay, que bueno.</i>

372

Everyone says hello.

373

<i>Ay, Tabby, please,
just stay on the phone.</i>

374

No, no, no.

375

<i>There's a police detective.
He gave me his card.</i>

376

Mom, Mom, I-I...
I can't stay here for long.

377

I'm sorry. Um...

378

<i>Okay, but you have to call him.</i>

379

- Uh...
<i>- Mi amor!</i>

380

You might not hear from me
for a little bit, but...

381

<i>No, no, no! No, no, no!
You have to stay here!</i>

382

I just don't
want you to be afraid.

383

I'm okay, okay?
Everything's okay.

384

<i>¿Ay, pero cuándo?</i>

385

- I love you, Mom.
<i>- Tabby!</i>

386

I'm so sorry, Mom.
I-I have to go.

387

I love you so much, okay?
Everything's okay.

388

[sobbing]
Mom, I love you. Bye.

389

- Thank you.
- Thanks.

390

Why would you do that?

391

You seriously need to
disinfect your phone now.

[Kristi]
When are you guys leaving?

397

[Kenny]
As soon as Jim's ready.

398

My mom insisted on putting
together our rations.

399

Yeah, Moms'll do that.

400

Yep.

401

Are you sure about all this?

402

\Mom, that's too much.
We can't...

403

[in Cantonese]

404

Ma...

405

{\an8}[Kenny] Yes.

406

[in Cantonese]

407

It's gonna be fine!

408

You guys worry too much.

409

Are you really
gonna go find Mom?

410

Well, I'm gonna do my best.

411

But I can't do that

412

if I'm worried
about things back here.

413

So, no more running off, okay?

414

Okay.

415

Shake on it.

416

Good man.

417

I love you, Dad.

418

I love you, too.

419

Promise you'll be careful?

420

I promise.

421

I'll be back soon.

422

- Yeah.
- You got it. Okay.

423

You ready?
We're burning daylight.

424

- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

425

Right, and remember what I
told you about those trees.

426

You start seeing spiderwebs,
then you know you are going

427

- in the right direction.
- Yeah, got it.

428

And whatever you do, make sure
you get back to the hut by dark.

429

Yeah.
We're gonna be okay.

430

Okay?
I'll see you soon.

431

Okay.

432

Hey! Dad!

433

Wha...?

434

You gotta come to the fields!
Come on!

435

[man] Let's see what
we can dig up...

436

[breathing heavily]

437

No, no. Please.
What are we gonna do?

438

They're all fuckin' rotten!

439

[gasps]

440

[groans]

441

[grunts]

442

[Boyd]
Donna!

443

First things we pulled up,

444

it was a few rotten carrots,
beets and potatoes.

445

So, we pulled up some more.
They were rotten too.

446

Everything that survived
the storm is rotten.

447

Boyd, we're out of food.

448

How many people did you
have up here with you?

449

Donna!

450

How many people know?

451

- [shouting indistinctly]
- Go! You go home now!

452

Look, I'm sorry, okay?

453

But every ounce of
food we have left

454

is in those jars
in your basement!

455

You have no right to keep
it locked away down there!

456

No!

457

Those for everybody!

458

There more crop coming!

459

You don't know what
you're talking about.

460

Everything else is rotten!

461

This is all
the food we have now!

462

No!

463

Please go home!

464

Go home!

465

No, my house! No!

466

Come on.

467

What are you doing?

468

You're not... look, kid, I don't
like this any more than you do,

469

but the shit is
on the fan, all right?

470

You can't!
She's my friend!

471

- Enough, all right?
- Stop! Stop!

472

The kid is one thing,

473

but you, I'm gonna
fucking hit, all right?

474

Randall, what are you doing?

475

- Hey, hey!
- I said, "Stop."

476

- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Ellis] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

477

- Victor, don't. No, no, no!
- Just...

478

No, no! Hey, hey!
Stop, stop, stop! Victor?

479

Hey, hey, hey.

480

So, this guy's got a gun?
Are you fucking kidding me?

481

Is that seriously what you're
focusing on right now?

482

Hey. Put it down, buddy.

483

Victor? Victor...

484

Put it down.

485

All right. Okay.

486

Now, give me the gun, buddy.

487

No.

488

Please, buddy.

489

[Randall] Great.

490

Can I take my goat now, huh?

491

Those animals are off-limits.

492

Those animals are the only food
that we have now.

493

That's right.

494

They provide eggs.
They provide milk.

495

They are a resource.

496

And if you hadn't noticed,

497

we're running pretty fucking
thin on those these days.

498

Listen, what happened today...

499

Uh, hey...

500

what happened today
was a setback, and I get it.

501

I get that we're scared.

502

I get that...
I get that we're hungry.

503

But we are...

504

Look, we are
still in this thing.

505

We can still win.

506

But whatever we do,
we have to do it carefully.

507

We have to make
everything last. Okay?

508

This place will not break us!

509

The only way we go home...
is together.

510

Okay?

511

So...

512

So, give us time
to figure this out.

513

Give me that.

514

Or...

515

...we can do this,

516

right here, right now.

517

[sighs]
Just give him the goat.

518

You people don't
have any fucking idea.

519

You don't.

520

- Thank you.
- Whatever.

521

Hey, bud.

522

- You okay?
- You okay?

523

Should we take Alma back?
Hey, could you...?

524

Yeah.

525

- Come on, Alma.
- [goat bleats]

526

I appreciate what you're doing.
I want you to know that.

527

Coming out here with me...
thank you.

528

[Kenny]
You don't have to thank me.

529

Yeah, I do. I do.

530

Look, we're gonna
do everything we can.

531

We're gonna be safe,
and we're gonna be smart...

532

[foreboding music playing]

533

What the fuck?

534

♪

535

Hey, Jim, wait.

536

We should turn around.

537

♪

538

Jim, we should head back
to the talisman hut.

539

It's gonna get dark soon.

540

These look pretty solid.

541

We could just hang the talisman
in one of these things,

542

start from here in the morning.

543

You're serious?

544

What's the difference of
sleeping in one of these things

545

or sleeping in the talisman hut?

546

Boyd said, if we saw
spiderwebs in the trees,

547

then we'd know we were heading
in the right direction.

548

He didn't say anything
about weird statues and...

549

Maybe Boyd's tent got
dragged past all this.

550

'Kay. If we're gonna
spend the night here,

551

we should take a look around,
make sure there's no surprises.

552

All right.

553

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

554

Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

555

I can't really remember
when my last confession was.

556

You're here now.
That's what matters.

557

I needed to talk to someone,

558

and I didn't know
where else to go.

559

I can't tell anyone who I am,
that I'm here.

560

They'll think I'm crazy.

561

I just called my mom.

562

That may have done more harm
than good. I don't know.

563

I don't know how I got here.

564

Nothing that I've
been through is possible.

565

I feel like my mind is breaking.

566

Whenever we reach our limits,
God will always

567

be there to break our fall.

568

No, no, no. Please...

569

Please don't do that.

570

I didn't come here
to talk about God.

571

Why not?

572

Because if God is real, then
He made that horrible place.

573

He created
all the pain and suffering.

574

He was the one that let my baby
fall off that changing table.

575

[sobbing]

576

I'm sorry, Father.
This was a mistake.

577

Please, wait!

578

I'm fine. It's okay.

579

What was his name?

580

What?

581

Your child, the one you lost,

582

What was his name?

583

Thomas.

584

That's a good name.

585

You have other children?

586

The lunchbox.

587

This belongs
to a man named Victor.

588

He fixed me a snack
before I left.

589

Before you left where?

590

A place where
monsters come out at night.

591

A place that no one can leave.

592

But, see, I went through a tree
that took me to a lighthouse.

593

And then, a little boy
pushed me out, saying,

594

"This is the only way."

595

The only way to what?

596

I-I don't... I don't know.

597

I have no clue what I'm supposed
to do here or where to go.

598

My family is trapped
in a terrifying place,

599

and I don't know how
to get back to them.

600

What kind of snack
did Victor make?

601

You think I'm crazy, right?

602

I think you're in pain,

603

and I'd like to help, if I can.

604

Humor me.

605

He's still such
a little boy... Victor.

606

What it must have
been like for him,

607

growing up alone
in a place like that.

608

Oh, my God. I have to go.

609

There's no need to rush.

610

No, it's okay, it's okay.
I know where to go. Thank you!

611

You know,
this place isn't half bad

612

once you have the right hobby.

613

You really need
to get some rest.

614

Boyd said it was okay
to sleep again.

615

It's not that. It's...

616

I feel like something
is watching me.

617

But then, I wake up
and I can never remember.

618

I-I...

619

Is that her?

620

She looks scary.

621

[breathing rapidly]

622

[gasping]

623

[breathing rapidly]

624

[Donna] The one thing that has
kept people hanging on

625

is the fact that we still
had crops coming in.

626

[Boyd]
Well, they're gone.

627

So, now we gotta
figure out what comes next.

628

Right...

629

So, then, what do we have
left in terms of rations?

630

Left? We don't have
anything left.

631

What little we had just walked
out the door in a panic!

632

Then we get it back.

633

[Donna]
And then what?

634

Even if we get everything
they took, which we won't,

635

it will still be
nowhere near enough!

636

Then, we gotta
talk about the animals.

637

We gotta figure out
if those animals out there

638

can feed everyone long enough
to plant a new crop.

639

The soil is poisoned!

640

Everything is poisoned!

641

All right,
so, you wanna give up? Huh?!

642

Hey! Look at me!

643

Should we just lay down and die?

644

Because I'm not
ready to do that!

645

We got one resource left! One!

646

And we start killing those
animals without a plan,

647

we are done!

648

You wanna be the one to tell
Fatima her baby's gonna starve

649

before it's born?
Go ahead!

650

We plant smaller crop.

651

Different places.
Different soil.

652

Okay.

653

Let's say we... we do that.

654

We need those animals
to buy us...

655

three months?

656

We got enough for that?

657

If we slaughter the cows
one at a time,

658

they could last us
at least a month.

659

Maybe more.

660

How about the goats?

661

Uh, we can...

662

Ethan.

663

[gasps]

664

Uh...

665

Hey.

666

Hey.

667

Mind if I join you?

668

Sure.

669

I guess you heard what
we were talking about in there.

670

You have to kill the animals
to feed the town.

671

Yeah.

672

Can't you find another way?

673

[breathes deeply]

674

I wish I could do that.
I really do.

675

Those animals down there...

676

they're gonna save us.

677

They're gonna
keep everybody alive

678

till we figure all this out.

679

They're gonna be heroes.

680

Can you make sure
Alma goes first?

681

Why?

682

'Cause then she won't have
to watch her friends die.

683

[children's indistinct
chattering, squealing]

684

[engine turns off]

685

Oh, for Christ's sake.

686

Get lost.
I'm not in the mood.

687

Do you hear me?
Get the hell out of here.

688

You Deaf?
I said get the...

689

Where did you get that?

690

Oh, my God.

691

I asked you a question.

692

Where did you get that?

693

You're...
You're his father.

694

You're Victor's father.

695

[fire crackling]

696

You're right
about the spiderwebs.

697

What?

698

The trees with the spiderwebs.

699

Boyd's exact words were,

700

"They're fuckin' everywhere.
You can't miss 'em."

701

So, if we haven't seen
any spiderwebs by now,

702

we're probably headed
in the wrong direction.

703

So, what do you wanna do?

704

We should probably get up
to some higher ground,

705

see if we can't get
a lay of the land.

706

[rustling, twigs snapping]

707

[rustling]

708

[rustling continues]

709

[rustling continues, thudding]

710

[breathing rapidly]

711

[wall thudding]

712

[footsteps depart]

713

[whispers] I think it's gone.

714

[Jim] We can't do this.

715

If I die out here,

716

I'll be leaving
my kids with nothing.

717

There's a reason she went alone.

718

Because if something
goes wrong...

719

one of us has
to be there for the kids.

720

If she's...

721

She wouldn't want me out here.

722

We'll head home
first thing in the morning.

723

[animals bleating]

724

[suspenseful music playing]

725

[door creaks]

726

[groans] Oh, fuck.

727

[exhales deeply] Hey.

728

Hi.

729

Want a little hair of the dog?

730

Oh, you been holding out.

731

[chuckles]
Where'd this come from?

732

Father Khatri
buried it in a sack

733

with a bloody shirt
and a candy bar.

734

[laughs] What?

735

It's a long story.

736

You ready to tell me
what's going on with you?

737

Not yet.

738

Still kinda
working it out for myself.

739

But, uh...

740

I don't think we're
doing very well here, Sheriff.

741

- Hmm.

758

Come on, Ginger, good girl.

We'll put up a talisman
if we have to, okay?

before the bad things come.

765

Wait. You have to stay inside!

766

- Okay.

Everything be okay.

Tien-Chen, pull her.
You got it.

There you go. You got her?

Okay. Okay.

[nightmare creature] You said
this place couldn't break you.

Do you remember that, Boyd?

"You don't fucking break me."

fucking things off me!

- Boyd!
- Kill me!

875

But you leave her alone!

876

We're not gonna kill you, Boyd.

That would be no fun.

You think this place
can't break you?
