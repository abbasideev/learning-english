What the fuck?

3

[Jim] Kenny!
You gotta come down here!

4

There's enough food here to feed
everybody in the entire town!

5

You think this place can't
break you?

6

Let's see.

7

- [Tian-Chen screaming]
- [Boyd shouting]

8

[Jade] You were in the barn
with her with those things.

9

How are you still alive?

10

They wanted me to watch.

11

- Kenny.
- Wait. Where's... where's my mom?

12

Bud, I'm s...

13

No! Stop! Just stop.

14

[crying]

15

[Boyd]
We need more information.

16

- [Ellis] Yeah.
- [Boyd] I'm gonna need

17

your help with
something tomorrow.

18

With what?

19

We're gonna catch one
of these fucking things.

20

[Donna]
You're gonna have a baby

21

that you were told
you could never have!

22

With all you've seen,

23

you can't wrap your head
around a miracle.

24

[Marielle] You're
severely malnourished.

25

We really just need
to get you eating again.

26

Are those the crops?

27

Yeah. We figured
we'd try composting them,

28

see if we can't get
the soil turned around.

29

Mmm.

30

[smashing]

31

Jade?

32

[whispering indistinctly]

33

You ready to tell me
what's going on with you?

34

Still kinda working it
out for myself.

35

Do you remember
the bracelet I made you?

36

You're saying
you found a bracelet

37

that's similar
to the one you made?

38

No, no, no, no, no.
It's not similar.

39

That is the bracelet.

40

It's impossible.

41

[Victor]
Visit the bottle tree.

42

My mother said this one
would take her to the tower,

43

to the children.

44

[Henry] Miranda
started seeing things.

45

She painted everything she saw.

46

She said it was like
she'd been chosen

47

to free the children.

48

I guess you've been
chosen now, too.

49

When Thomas died,
you and Mom fell apart,

50

and there was no one
there for Ethan.

51

I need you to get
your shit together.

52

Okay.

53

[ringing]

54

Hello?

55

[boy] <i>Dad? It's Thomas.</i>

56

[static crackling]

57

<i>Daddy, are you there?</i>

58

[static crackling]

59

You are not my son.

60

[boy]
<i>Why did you let Mommy go?</i>

61

[static crackling]

62

<i>Why did you want her to die?</i>

63

Stop it!

64

<i>Is it because you
didn't love her anymore?</i>

65

[static crackling]

66

What do you want?

67

[boy] <i>To help.
You need help, Daddy.</i>

68

Stop calling me that.

69

[boy] <i>You should be
watching Julie and Ethan.</i>

70

<i>You shouldn't let them play
outside so close to dark.</i>

71

[static crackling]

72

<i>Daddy, are you there?</i>

73

Ethan!

[bell continuing to clang]

Julie!

Ethan! Julie!

80

[bell continuing to clang]

81

Ethan!

82

[bell continuing to clang]

83

Julie!

84

What?

85

What are you doing?

86

Feeding the animals!

87

Come on inside!

88

- Ethan!
- We're not done yet!

89

Hey, Ethan! I said right now!
Come on!

90

- Jim!
- Huh?

91

[Boyd] You okay?

92

Yeah. You know, I'm...
I'm talking to my kids.

93

- Come on. Ethan.
- [sheep bleating]

94

- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- We're coming!

95

It's gonna be dark soon.

96

I know.

97

- They okay?
- [Jim] Yeah.

98

Sorry.

Things are getting worse

- [Henry grunting]

127

Wha?

128

[grunting]

129

Uh, easy now.
You'll cut yourself.

130

Ow!
[groaning]

131

Told you.

132

Were you down there all night?

133

You... You need to sleep.

134

[groaning]

135

I need... I need answers.

136

There has to be something
in that basement,

137

in... in... in those paintings
that I'm missing.

138

I got some bandages
in here somewhere.

139

Ah.

140

There we are.

141

Uh, no. Uh, you...

142

- Help me, please.
- Oh, no, no. It's all right.

143

So, that boy,

144

the... the one
dressed in white,

145

you're saying that he lured you

146

up to the top of a lighthouse

147

and... and then
pushed you out?

148

No, no, no, no, no.
He didn't lure me.

149

I just went there because
of, you know, the children.

150

Children locked in the tower.

151

Yeah. You see, um...
[sighing]

152

...the tower was
actually a lighthouse,

153

and in order to get there,

154

I had to go through a tree.

155

Uh, Victor took me there.

156

He said his mother had gone off
to save the children as well,

157

the night she... she...

158

It's all right.

159

You can say it.

160

I, uh, accepted
the fact that she died

161

a long, long time ago.

162

I thought they all had.

163

The fact that Victor is
still out there somewhere,

164

it's...

165

[glass clinking]

166

Do you hear that?

167

[clinking continuing]

168

Oh, the bottles.

169

Of course I hear them.

170

They're hanging, uh,
on a tree in the backyard.

171

Miranda used to call it
the bottle tree.

172

[bird calling distantly]

173

[Victor] One, two, three.

174

[children chattering]

175

[Victor murmuring]

176

[murmuring]

177

[murmuring]

178

[grunting]

179

How do you even know
that this is possible?

180

Yeah. I don't,

181

but the talismans,

182

they keep those things from
getting into the houses.

183

Maybe it can keep them from
getting out of something.

184

Look. I get it, but we're not
talking about catching

185

a stray dog or a coyote, okay?

186

Those... those things, we don't
know anything about them.

187

Yeah. Well, maybe
it's time we learned.

188

We can't just sit around
playing it safe anymore.

189

"Safe."

190

You spent one night out
in the forest,

191

and it almost got you killed.

192

And then it almost got
everybody killed, but "safe."

193

Jim and Kenny spent the night
out in the forest, right?

194

And they came back with food,

195

and now, we have enough food
to feed everyone again!

196

The point is, it's not always

197

gonna work out the way
that we want it to,

198

but that doesn't mean
we can't take chances.

199

- I'm with you, okay?
- [door opens]

200

I...

201

How'd it go with,
uh, Kenny and the others?

202

Fine. We all drew straws,
Dale threw a shit-fit,

203

and they all went on their way.

204

Should be down there
by lunchtime.

205

And how did Kenny seem?

206

As good as can be expected.

207

Kristi's down there with them.

208

Good. Yeah.

209

All right.
What the fuck's going on?

210

Okay. If you don't
tell her, I will.

211

[sighing]

212

I wanna catch
one of those things.

213

Sorry. What?

214

Those things show up
every night,

215

every goddamn night,

216

and we still have no idea
what we're dealing with,

217

what they are,
where they come from.

218

Boyd, we have been
down this road.

219

You have already caught one.

220

No. I killed one.

221

That's different.

222

We need to learn about them.

223

We... We already know
they talk,

224

so we catch one.
We make it talk.

225

Oh, you're gonna make it talk.

226

How are you gonna do that?

227

You gonna torture it?

228

We have hit those things
point blank with shotguns,

229

and all it makes them do
is smile!

230

They are not human.

231

Well, according to Kristi,
they were at some point!

232

Oh, and what part of that
reassures you?

233

[shouting] We gotta do
something, all right?

234

- Dad.
- You can't...

235

We gotta fucking do something.

236

How you gonna do it?

237

I am working on that.

238

Great.

239

Work harder.

240

Look.

241

I miss Tian-Chen, too,

242

and believe me, I do not
want us to not go out there

243

and get our pound of flesh.

244

But I do not want
to watch you get killed

245

because of some
half-baked, dumbass plan.

246

And don't you encourage him.

247

You got a baby on the way.

248

You have more to worry about now
than yourself.

249

- Dad...
- No.

250

All right.

251

- I'll talk to you later.
- Yep. Yep.

252

[sizzling]

253

- [sizzling]
- [chattering]

254

What is that?

255

They divvied up the rest
of the cow this morning.

256

We got plenty, if you want some.

257

I don't think so.

258

Baby's not a meat-eater, huh?

259

I guess not.

260

[retching]

261

♪

262

Well, that's terrifying.

263

I can't believe people
actually lived out here.

264

[Dale] Are we sure
they were people?

265

I mean, look at this.

266

Just look
at how they're positioned.

267

They may have been using them

268

the same way
we use the talismans,

269

warding off evil spirits.

270

Oh, that's much more comforting.

271

Whatever happened,
it was a long time ago.

272

We have people back in town
who are hungry now.

273

So, uh, all right,
Jim and I pulled

274

and gathered as much
as we could before we left.

275

It's up in that shack
over there.

276

So, let's get, uh,
get Dale, Jade, Roger.

277

You guys can get started there.

278

The rest of us will go forage
whatever else we can find.

279

- Let's go! Wasting daylight!
- Great.

280

- [Kristi] Careful.
- Great.

281

Let's just walk right past
the scary voodoo tower

282

and go sort some veggies.

283

I did the best I could
with what we had left.

284

Good news is,
when Kenny and the others

285

get back with the food,

286

we'll be off rations.

287

Won't that be good?

288

I guess so.

289

[footsteps approaching]

290

I made some lunch.
Do you want some?

291

No.

292

All right.

293

Who's gonna bury her?

294

What?

295

Who's gonna bury Mom?

296

Don't talk like that!

297

But...

298

what if her body's just laying
out there on the ground

299

with bugs and spiders?

300

Will her body just lay there
'til it starts to rot?

301

Ethan.

302

But what if someone
finds her someday,

303

and they don't know who she is
'cause all they find is bones?

304

- Stop!
- [clattering]

305

God damn it! Stop!

306

- I'm sorry. I...
- Yeah.

307

Really gunning
for parent of the year, huh?

308

[phone ringing]

309

[phone ringing]

310

[phone ringing]

311

[Henry]
Uh, Miranda was an artist.

312

She did all sorts of
installations all over town.

313

This was always
one of her favorites.

314

You're saying
there's something like this

315

in that town you came from?

316

[Tabitha] No.
This was different.

317

[sighing]
It's not here.

318

What... What are you
looking for?

319

The tree that Victor took me to

320

had some sort of,
like, opening, you know,

321

one that you can, like, step in,

322

and it will just
take you somewhere.

323

So, you would step
into the tree,

324

like teleporting?

325

It doesn't matter.
It's just a tree.

326

Well, it's not the original,

327

if that matters.

328

- What?
- Well, like I said,

329

she... she did
installations all over.

330

She liked this one so much,
she made a replica

331

for the... for the yard.

332

Said she wanted it
to be close to her.

333

The original's in a park
a few towns over.

334

In fact...

335

What? In fact what?

336

Well, that was where
we dropped acid together.

337

You could say that tree

338

was where this all started.

339

Oh, my God, and how...
how far is it from here?

340

Thirty, 40 minutes.

341

Okay. You need
to take me there right now.

342

- You need to get some sleep.
- No, no, no, no, no.

343

You need to take me there
right now, Henry!

344

You're not gonna do
either of us any good

345

if you end up back
in the hospital!

346

I'm not gonna... I'm not
gonna go to the hospital.

347

I just need to go to the tree.
Please take me! Let's go!

348

[murmuring]

349

[Khatri] So, is this some part
of your nefarious plan?

350

You really think you can
catch one of those things?

351

Maybe.

352

[hammering]

353

Boyd, you've been here, what?
Year and half now?

354

Done pretty well
by most metrics, you know.

355

You kept most people alive
who'd otherwise be dead.

356

[hammering]

357

Present company excluded,
of course.

358

So why change things now?

359

Look around you.

360

Look at all the shit
that's happening lately.

361

You really gotta ask me that?

362

Well, at least you have
a solid plan, right?

363

Lure one of those things
into a house.

364

Slap a talisman
on the outside of the door.

365

Trap it inside.

366

Next day, go over.
Go inside.

367

Wander around the house,

368

searching for it room by room
until it jumps out

369

from somewhere
and rips you to pieces.

370

Yeah, no, I can see
how the military trusted you

371

to plan things.

372

You don't see it, do you?

373

Boyd, you can't even see what's
staring you right in the face.

374

Which is?

375

[Khatri] Those things said
they wanted to break you,

376

and that means
they wanted to change you.

377

So far, so good, because
the Boyd I knew would

378

never do something
this colossally stupid.

379

Yeah, well, the Boyd
you knew got you killed.

380

[chuckling] You know,
you might wanna

381

get down off of that cross
of yours every now and then.

382

- You know that?
- You know, fuck you, man.

383

I died because
I was trying to help people.

384

Tian-Chen, she died because
she was trying to help people.

385

You have any idea
how arrogant it is

386

to diminish that sacrifice
by making this all about you?

387

But I really like
your fancy art.

388

It's nice.

389

It's a memory board.

390

The graveyard has no markers,
no headstones, just bodies.

391

Probably bodies buried
all over the place.

392

We should have
a place for their names.

393

Your name, Tian-Chen's.

394

You know, I think better
when I work with my hands,

395

so leave me the fuck alone, huh?

[people chattering outside]

[knocking on door]

400

Hi.

401

Hello.

402

Do you need something?

403

Yes.

404

Do you want to come in?

405

So, what can I help you with?

406

What is that?

407

My brother made it for me.

408

I don't think I'll ever be able
to put it back together,

409

but I like to try.

410

Do you have a bedspread?

411

Yeah. I have
a few upstairs. Why?

412

We need to build a fort.

413

Then I'm gonna tell a story.

414

[knocking on door]

415

It's Tillie.

416

Can I come in?

417

Um, I'm really not
feeling great right now.

418

I used to lick eggshells.

419

When I was pregnant
with my first,

420

I used to lick
the inside of eggshells.

421

Yep.

422

Um, I couldn't stand

423

the sight or the smell
of my favorite foods,

424

but crack an egg and leave
the shell on the counter.

425

I would even sneak 'em
from the garbage

426

when my husband wasn't looking.

427

It started, um,

428

somewhere
in my second trimester.

429

Lasted three weeks

430

and... and then stopped
mysteriously as it began.

431

Whatever's going on,

432

I promise it'll pass.

433

[sighing]

434

Yeah, maybe.

435

[crying]

436

It's okay.

437

It's okay.

438

I can't...

439

I can't talk to anyone.

440

You know what they do here.

441

I'm afraid
that they would think...

442

And Ellis, he's so...

443

He's happy again,

444

actually happy.

445

And he's...
he's working so hard,

446

trying so hard
to be encouraging,

447

and I can't...

448

Can't what?

449

I can't tell him
how scared I am.

450

What if there's something wrong
with the baby?

451

What if...

452

Every first-time mother
has these feelings.

453

I'm not supposed to be a mom.

454

I was never supposed to be one!

455

I'm not...

456

I was never supposed
to be able to conceive,

457

and yet, somehow, here...

458

I just want to know
if the baby's gonna be okay.

459

Well, then, let's find out.

460

Uh, it's not locked.

461

Okay.

[Kristi] I'm pretty sure

514

Yeah. We gotta make sure
we bring back

515

as much as possible
this first trip.

Kenny?

Kenny, look at me.

518

What?

Look, I can't even
begin to imagine

what you're
going through right now,

and I'm not gonna pretend like

522

I know the magic words
that are just somehow...

Where's your bag?

524

What?

525

Your bag, the one
you're supposed to be

526

putting crops in.
Is it full?

527

Is that why you came out here?
To play nursemaid?

528

No, Kenny. I came out here
because I care about you.

529

That's great. Why don't
you care about me while

530

you do your fucking job?
Because we have two hours left,

531

and if we don't bring back
as much food as possible...

You can't just leave.

I can do whatever the fuck I
want, and right now, I wanna go.

534

- Hey! What's going on?
- I'm going back to town!

535

Uh, Jade, you're never gonna
make it back before dark.

536

Well, I'm sure as fuck
not staying here!

537

Let's all just take
a breath, okay?

538

I played along with the whole
"Let's draw straws

539

to see who gets the food"

540

- I came out here to help!
- Okay.

I don't like it here.

Who the fuck likes it anywhere?

543

It's a forest
full of nightmares!

544

No. This is different.
This is diff... Look.

545

I wanna help. I do, okay?
I wanna help, but I...

546

I'll be more helpful
back in town.

547

Hey, hey, hey, hey! You're not
gonna make it back to town.

548

Okay? You might not even make it
back to the talisman hut,

549

so just breathe, okay?

550

I'll make it if I run.

551

[Kenny] Just stop.
Okay. Stop. Stop.

552

We have shelter here.

553

We have...
we have talismans here,

554

and we need this food.

555

Jade, if we go
back to town empty-handed,

556

people starve.

557

Good luck.

558

- Jade!
- [Kenny] He's right.

559

If he hurries, he'll probably
make it back to the talisman hut

560

before sundown.

You're going the wrong way!

Oh, trust me.
I've done nothing

I should be back at the bar,

Looks good to me.

Why don't you take
all these in the back

595

and get them cleaned?

596

Okay.

597

Hey, little man.

598

Hi, Sheriff.

599

And what are you guys up to?

600

[Ethan] We're just making sure
everything's clean

601

and put away the way
Tian-Chen would like it.

602

Oh, wow.
That's really...

603

I'm sure she appreciates that.

604

I hope so.

605

[door swinging]

606

Came down here to get
one of the big pots

607

for soup for Colony House,

608

and when I got here,
I found him cleaning.

609

Poor kid.

610

He's had so much
to deal with already.

611

And what about you?

612

How you doing?

613

614

Aside from trying to process

615

everything
that's happened recently,

616

617

my grandmother told me
somehow...

618

[sighing]
I... I don't know

619

how I'm doing,
if I'm being honest.

620

Do you?

621

[sighing]

622

It's been a rough stretch.

623

Is it always like this?

624

Does it get worse?

625

I mean, well,
if I'm being honest,

626

I don't know.

627

But... but I do know

628

that no matter
what this place throws at us,

629

we're gonna win, all right?

630

No matter what happens here,

631

we are going
to find our way home.

632

What if there isn't one?

633

Well, of course there is.

634

There's a way here, right?

635

If there's a way here,
there's a way home.

636

You don't know that.

637

You just hope there is.

638

Tian-Chen thought she was
going home, and so did my mom.

639

Hey, we are not giving up
on your mom, okay?

640

Maybe you should.

641

It's a good thing, too,

650

Let's see if I can
wedge this in there.

651

- Okay. Just back up. Back up.
- I'm just trying to help.

652

You've helped! Gimme that.

653

You wanna go back to town, go!
Get the fuck outta here.

654

Kenny, we gotta get
this thing off her leg

655

before the sun goes down!

656

Really, Jade? Thanks!
Get the fuck outta here!

657

Enough!
This is nobody's fault,

658

so just cut the shit
and let's figure this out!

659

Why don't we just
break the chain?

660

At least then
we could get her inside.

661

- Break it with what?
- I don't know, smart guy.

You're supposed
to be the genius.

673

What?

Just don't do anything
until we get back!

677

I know they're here somewhere.

678

Poor thing's exhausted.

679

I'm glad he's finally
getting some rest.

680

Ah. Here they are.

681

Those what I think they are?

682

They are if you think
they're tarot cards.

683

You can't be serious.

684

Oh. You wanna know
if your baby's all right?

685

These here are gonna tell us.

686

This was a bad idea.

687

Hey!
Where are you going?

688

Where am I going?

689

I opened up to you.

690

I confided in you. I...

691

You know what? Your whole kooky,
batty Tillie shtick

692

is fine in most circumstances,
but how dare you?

693

Now, hold on a second.

694

Is that what you think of me?

695

Kooky, batty Tillie,

696

just goofing around about
something this important to you?

697

Is that what you think of me?

698

I don't know.

699

I don't know anything about you.
Look. Just...

700

Now so, you don't believe.

701

That's fine,

702

but before you saw
that tree in the road,

703

I'll bet you didn't believe
in half the stuff we see here

704

every day and night, did you?

705

These things played
a pretty big role in my life

706

at a pretty critical juncture.

707

I just want to share
that with you.

708

These cards were given to me
by a gal named Gertie.

709

She was in the same
hospice care as my husband.

710

[sighing]

711

She did a reading for me
after he passed.

712

Shuffle, please.

713

I thought that it was
a bit silly at the time,

714

but now I realize
that those cards...

715

...told me about my cancer,

716

told me about this place,

717

maybe not in so many words,

718

but the signs were all there
if I'd known how to read them.

719

Please?

720

Thank you.

721

Do you now know
how to read them?

722

Yeah, a lot better
than I was before.

723

[sighing]

724

Ask them a question.

725

And let's see what they answer.

726

The worst thing
that could happen

727

is you feel a bit silly
once we're done.

728

Is my baby okay?

729

Let's see what the cards
have to say.

730

enough to pry that trap open.

start pulling apart

739

of holy scary shit?

740

I'm sure whoever
built it won't mind.

742

Oh, Jesus. Fuck!

743

Where the hell are they?

744

Kenny, listen to me.

745

Yeah.

746

If this goes bad...

747

Hey, stop, stop.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

748

- Okay, Ken...
- We still have

749

- plenty of daylight left.
- Kenny!

out of this thing,

No matter what happens here,
you'll never be alone.

You'll never be alone, okay?
