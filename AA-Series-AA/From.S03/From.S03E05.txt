[Boyd] <i>Previously on</i> From...

2

[Ethan]
Ever since you fell asleep

3

and your eyes got all white,
you've been different.

4

All I remember
is being more scared

5

than I've ever been
in my entire life.

6

[screaming]

7

[Tillie] You really need
to get some rest.

8

Boyd said it was okay
to sleep again.

9

It's not that. It's...

10

<i>I feel like something
is watching me.</i>

11

[breathing rapidly]

12

Help me.

13

You're...
you're Victor's father.

14

Miranda used to call it
the bottle tree.

15

The original is in a park
a few towns over.

16

You need to take me
there right now.

17

[engine roaring, horn honking]

18

- Aah!
- [crash]

19

- [siren wailing]
- Where am I?

20

There's a tree in the middle
of the road.

21

- [crows cawing]
- Just take a detour!

22

- Go around it!
- You have to listen to me.

23

It's not safe to stop out here
once it gets dark.

24

<i>There are things in this town
that will hurt us.</i>

25

- [screeching]
- [yelping]

26

- Jim!
- Tabitha.

27

Please help us!

28

- There's a toolkit on the bus.
- I got it.

29

I can't find the fucking keys!

30

Are you looking for these?

31

We get to keep Randall, though.

32

- [buzzing]
- [screeching]

33

- What the fuck?
- [grunts]

34

- [woman] What was that?
- [man] Nicky's been shot!

35

She's bleeding internally.
Nicky, stay with me.

36

[pants]

37

You look much better.

38

You've been eating
a little more?

39

[Fatima] Yeah.

40

Finally found something
I could keep down.

41

[Boyd] Donna?

42

[sobbing]
Why is this happening?

43

Why can't they stop?

44

[gasping, coughing]

45

Everyone out of the way.

46

Out of the way!
Clear a path!

47

We're gonna need
some fresh towels!

48

Okay. This needs moving.

49

[woman] Okay, okay. Out of
the way. Out of the way.

50

All right. Get him down.

51

[people chattering]

52

[grunting]

53

[woman] Hurry!

54

- Please. Please!
- [woman] What happened?

55

- Get him some water.
- Jesus.

56

- Tell us what you need.
- [Randall groaning]

57

Easy.

58

Here.

59

Um, um, uh, I need something
to clean and stitch his face,

60

- and I need more towels!
- Why would they do this?

61

- Boyd?
- [Randall groaning louder]

62

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right. Okay.

63

No, no. Stop! Okay. No, no, no.
Hey. Oh. It's all right.

64

Stop. Take it easy.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

65

No, no, no.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

66

You're gonna hurt yourself.
Take it easy.

67

You did this. You fucking
left me out there, man.

68

You fucking left me out there!

69

You did this.
You fucking left me!

[grunting]

96

Hey, what happened?

97

Where the hell did
that come from?

98

- [Kenny] Okay. Easy.
- It was a long night. Come on.

99

- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

100

Kristi! Oh, my God!

101

- [Kristi] I'm okay.
- Jesus.

102

Okay. It could have
been a lot worse.

103

Here.
Let's get you inside.

104

- Yep.
- Ow, ow.

105

- Careful.
- Here.

106

- I got her.
- Okay.

107

[Kristi grunting]

108

Where's the food?

109

Dale and the others
are bringing it to storage.

110

What the hell
happened last night?

111

Boyd.

112

Tabitha's back.

113

What?

114

She was on the ambulance
when it came into town.

115

How?

116

Those weird trees in the forest,
she went through one.

117

She said it took her
to a lighthouse.

118

There's a meeting
in the diner this afternoon.

119

- Hey!
- It's okay.

120

Just let him go.

121

Let's go. All right.

122

Okay.

123

[people chattering quietly]

124

I don't think that's
quite your style.

125

I was told I could look
through these.

126

Of course.
What's ours is yours.

127

Thanks.

128

I, uh, I've sent some people
out to look for Victor.

129

It's not a big town.

130

I-I-If I'd known I...
I was gonna see him, I...

131

[chuckling]

132

...I would have worn
a better shirt.

133

[chuckles]

134

You know what?

135

There is a closet upstairs
where we keep the good stuff.

136

How 'bout we get you fixed up?

137

I'd appreciate that.

138

Okay. Let's do that.

139

Come on.

140

- Up here.
- [door creaks]

141

I thought you said Jasper
was in the tunnels.

142

He is.
We need supplies.

143

We can't go into the tunnels
unless we have supplies.

144

What supplies?

145

We need to make sure
we don't get lost.

146

[door closes]

147

What happened?

148

Last night was...
It was a bad night.

149

I'll wait outside.

150

[footsteps approaching]

151

- Victor.
- [door opens]

152

- Who died?
- [door closes]

153

Um... Nicky.

154

Oh.

155

And Randall got pretty torn up.

156

He's at the clinic now.

157

I need some things from my room.

158

Um, look, Victor.

159

Here. Come.
Come. with me.

160

Come on. Um...

161

[lowered voice] Something else
happened last night.

162

What?

163

- Tabitha came back.
- Really?

164

And she had someone with her.

165

Victor, your dad is here.

166

- That's not possible. He...
- He's upstairs.

167

- No.
- Look, look.

168

I know this is a lot to take in.

169

- No. No. No.
- Victor.

170

No. No. No.

171

- Victor!
- No!

172

That was quick.
Did you... Hey.

173

Victor!
Where are you going?

174

Victor, will you please
just tell me what happened?

175

I thought you said we
were going to get Jasper.

176

Hey, stop!

177

You're not being fair.

178

You came into my house,

179

you made me sit
in that fort, and now...

180

Donna said my dad is here.

181

What? How?

182

It doesn't matter.
You should go home.

183

Uh, we'll get Jasper later.

184

So, what was it like?

185

Uh, it was, um...

186

You know, it was scary,
waking up in the hospital,

187

not knowing if it was real
or if I was still dreaming.

188

So, you really
talked to Grandma?

189

I did.

190

I just... I just
don't understand.

191

How do you go from
a lighthouse in the woods

192

to a hospital in Maine?

193

Honey, I don't...
I don't know.

194

I wish I could explain.

195

The important thing is
that she's back,

196

- and we're all together.
- [door opens]

197

- [Jade] Hey!
- [door closes]

198

- I need to talk to you.
- Hey. Back off, man.

199

No, no, no. No.

200

Jim, it's okay.
It's okay.

201

Please.

202

Boyd said...
[exhales deeply]

203

Boyd said you went
through a tree?

204

They're called Farway trees.

205

There's a bunch of them
in the forest,

206

but this one has bottles on it.

207

The lighthouse.

208

Was it the same lighthouse
Miranda was looking for?

209

I mean, it has to be.

210

Can you get back there
without the tree?

211

I don't know.
I don't... I don't know.

212

Okay. Then we need to
go to the tree.

213

All right. So, hold on.

214

She just got back,
and you want to do what?

215

I'm not saying go through
it again, but I need to see it.

216

I've been there, okay?

217

It was the first place I looked
when she didn't come back.

218

There is...
there is nothing to see.

219

Oh. You mean besides
the magic tree.

220

Uh...

221

Okay. The bottles.
What about the bottles?

222

Was there anything special
about them?

223

I took a few of 'em down.

224

There were slips of paper inside
with numbers written on them.

225

Oh, my God. And you don't
think that's important?

226

I think this place
does a pretty great job

227

on messing with our heads.

228

Wait. No. This is different.

229

It has to be.

230

Look. I get that this place is
one giant mindfuck, but...

231

[clears throat]
Pardon my French.

232

But she went home, okay?

233

That's not a trick.
It's not a dream!

234

That's real, and there is
a whole town full of people

235

who are gonna be banging down
your door demanding answers

236

whether you have them or not.
Take me to the tree.

237

Let's see if we can find some.

238

I told Boyd that I was gonna
go to that town meeting.

239

Oh, fuck the town meeting!
Sorry.

240

Uh, okay. Look.

241

Town meeting isn't gonna
solve anything,

242

but going to the tree,

243

at least it's a start.

244

[grunting]

245

We had to leave some of the food
back at the settlement.

246

We, uh, we'll probably need
to send another team out

247

before the next snowfall.

248

Yeah. We'll figure it out.

249

Boyd, there is
something out there,

250

something different.

251

We heard it both times now,

252

walking around
outside the cabins at night.

253

Okay.

254

If walking around is
all it's doing,

255

then, uh, we got
bigger things to worry about.

256

[scoffs]

257

[sighs]

258

[Randall grunting]

259

What they did to Randall...

260

Why'd they leave him alive?
Why not just kill him?

261

[Boyd] I think they
want us to look at him.

262

When the sun's up,

263

they want us to remember
what's coming at night.

264

Part of the thing that
keeps people sane here

265

is we get to pretend
during the daytime,

266

pretend that we're safe.

267

With Randall walking around,

268

then we don't get
to pretend anymore.

269

I removed the bullet,
stabilized her.

270

One minute, she was fine,

271

and then all of a sudden,
she wasn't.

272

Jesus.

273

- [inhales sharply]
- Sorry.

274

[groans] yeah.

275

Okay.

276

God. It's a miracle
there are no fractures.

277

- Mari.
- Probably have ligament damage.

278

This should be elevated. I'm
gonna get you another pillow.

279

Mari, just stop
for a second, please.

280

Look, last night wasn't easy,

281

and it wasn't your fault, okay?

282

Yeah, well...
tell that to Nicky.

283

I'm telling you.

284

Look. I know what
it's like. I just... [sighs]

285

I don't...
I don't want you to...

286

What?

287

If you think
I'm gonna start spiraling

288

and stealing morphine again...

289

- I didn't... I didn't say that.
- Well, you didn't have to.

290

- [groans]
- Hey. Come here.

291

Come here.

292

Hey, you are
the patient right now.

293

Can you please just
stop worrying about me

294

and let me worry about you?

295

Can we worry about each other?

296

[chuckles]

297

[Randall groaning in pain]

298

I gotta go.

299

- Wait.
- Just get some rest, yeah?

300

- [door opens]
- [sighs]

301

[sighs]

302

[Randall groaning in pain]

303

- No. Boyd...
- I just wanna help.

304

I understand that.
Boyd, you being here

305

is just gonna make things worse.

306

[grunting]

307

I'm sorry.

308

No. You're right.

309

Look, people need you out there.

310

They're gonna need you at
the meeting later... both of you.

311

There's only so much
people can take,

312

and now,
with Tabitha being back,

313

- the fact that she went home...
- [grunting]

314

- I gotta...
- Yeah.

315

[groaning]

316

Hey, Randall. It's okay.

317

Squeeze my hand.
I'm going to take a look.

318

- All right.
- Yeah.

319

[Marielle] Yeah.
You're okay.

320

This is where he stays...

321

...most of the time.

322

Oh.

323

Uh, it... it's, uh...
[chuckles]

324

It's a little different from
his room at home. [chuckles]

325

[exhales deeply]

326

For the first few years,

327

every time I'd turn a corner,

328

there'd be
this little spark of hope

329

that maybe, just maybe,

330

I'd see all of them there...

331

Miranda, Eloise, Victor.

332

[stammers] And they...
they'd smile and laugh.

333

We'd all cry together about what
a terrible mistake it all was.

334

[chuckles] Then...

335

That was the hardest part...

336

that little bit of hope.
[sighs]

337

That was the part
I-I couldn't bear.

338

As the years went by,

339

it became easier
to tell myself they were dead.

340

They were gone.

341

So, that's what I did.

342

All that time,
my little boy was here, alone.

343

What kind of man gives up
on his family?

344

No wonder he doesn't wanna
talk to me.

345

Just give him a little time.

346

He'll come 'round.

347

[exhales deeply]

348

Sorry to interrupt,

349

but, uh, we're all
heading to the meeting.

350

I'll be right there.

351

Meeting?

352

People have a lot of questions
about what happened,

353

about Tabitha.

354

Sure.

355

It was kind of a big deal
that she got out of here.

356

[indistinct conversations]

357

[Dale] Come on.

358

Come on!

359

Okay, everybody,
just take a seat.

360

- Hey, come on in.
- [Donna] Sit down here. Come on.

361

[door closes]

362

[Boyd] Everybody grab...
grab a seat.

363

All right, everybody.
Okay. All right.

364

All right. Look.

365

I understand that everybody
wants answers, right?

366

- [all chattering]
- So do I, all right?

367

But the truth is,

368

there's no easy explanations
to any of this, okay?

369

- There's nothing that...
- Where the hell is Tabitha?

370

[all] Yeah. Yeah.

371

She's coming, all right?

372

Just try to remember,
she's been through a lot.

373

All due respect, Boyd, but we've
all been through a lot.

374

- [woman] That's right.
- [all murmuring]

375

- I understand that.
- [Dale] Are... are you sure?

376

'Cause I feel like if you had
any clue about anything,

377

she'd be the one
talking instead of you.

378

[all] Yeah.

379

Look. Everybody
calm the fuck down.

380

Hey, why were you
in the ambulance?

381

Well, uh, we were
in an accident.

382

I was taking Tabitha
to a park near my...

383

Tabitha's here.

384

[chattering]

385

What do I say?

386

Just tell 'em the truth.

387

[chattering]

388

- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

389

Yeah.

390

Did you really
go through a tree?

391

Hey, let's let her talk.

392

It's okay. Um, uh, I did. Yes.

393

Um...

394

I-I imagine some
of you already know this,

395

but, um, there are
some trees in the forest

396

that aren't like
the other trees.

397

Hey. Town meeting's
already started.

398

Yeah. I just gotta
grab something.

399

[door closes]

400

[knock on door]

401

Hello?

402

<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

403

[Fatima]
<i>'Cause I wanted you to see</i>

404

that if you climb high enough,

405

even a nightmare can
look like a dream.

406

Hello?

407

- [sighs] Hey, Elgin.
- [grunts]

408

[gasps] Oh, my...
What the fuck?

409

I'm so sorry. I...
[stammers] I thought you...

410

- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

411

Are you okay?

412

No. Not really. I...

413

- I'm sorry.
- Uh, no. Wait.

414

I could use some company,

415

if you're not, uh,
you know, busy.

416

Sure.

417

Victor?
What are you doing?

418

It's cold out here.

419

I never drew pictures of him.

420

What?

421

When I was alone here,
I never...

422

I always drew pictures
of things that I saw,

423

because I knew
the pictures would remember,

424

but I never...
I never drew pictures

425

of what came before.

426

And now I told myself
that was a dream and that...

427

that he was...

428

Victor...

429

None of that matters.

430

- He's here.
- [murmurs]

431

Somehow, your father is here,

432

and he's waiting
for you back in town.

433

No. No. He's waiting
for a little boy

434

that drove away a long time ago.

435

What's he gonna think...

436

...when he sees... me?
[sighs]

437

I don't know.

438

I know I'm supposed to
tell you that it'll be okay,

439

and he'll love you
no matter what.

440

But I don't know if that's true.

441

You're really bad at this.

442

Sorry.

443

I don't know you that well,

444

but you seem like
a really good person,

445

and that's something
to be proud of here.

446

I would give anything to feel
like a good person again.

447

Maybe...

448

Maybe you're not the only one
who's afraid.

449

Maybe he's afraid
of not being the dad

450

that little boy remembers.

451

So, you see this woman
in the kimono

452

even when you're awake?

453

Now, I do. Yeah.

454

Well, is she trying to hurt you?

455

I thought she was at first,

456

but when I saw her last night,

457

she asked me for my help.

458

With what?

459

I don't know.

460

If my grandma was here,
she'd probably tell me

461

it was an angel or somethin'.

462

"Remember now, there's a reason
why angels say 'Fear not'

463

when they saw someone.

464

Even Gabriel was terrifying."

465

[chuckles] Wow.

466

Look at you,
Mr. Bible Study.

467

- [chuckles]
- [scoffs]

468

You wanna know
the fucked up part?

469

I would take the creepy
kimono woman in a heartbeat

470

over the shit
I hear in my head now.

471

[laughs]

472

Like what?

473

Mostly just screaming.

474

But I don't...

475

[sighs] I don't just hear it.
It's like...

476

It's like I can feel it, too.

477

This is the only thing
that makes it quiet.

478

You talk to your folks about it?

479

What are they gonna do?
[exhales deeply]

480

[coughs]

481

They're in the diner
right now with everyone else,

482

trying to figure out what
it means that my mom got out.

483

[scoffs]

484

What do you think it means?

485

Honestly, I don't think
it means anything.

486

I think
this whole place exists...

487

I think it's just here
to make us suffer.

488

Maybe that's why it let her out.

489

What do you mean?

490

Best way to make us suffer
is to give us hope.

491

I don't think
it's ever gonna let us go.

492

You're so depressing
when you're stoned.

493

[coughs and laughs]

494

Sorry.

495

[laughter]

496

[Tabitha] And then
the next thing I knew,

497

um, the ambulance had stopped.

498

The driver said that there was a
tree in the middle of the road,

499

and you all know
how things go from there.

500

Come on in.

501

- [door closes]
- When you were out there...

502

did you contact anyone?

503

Did you let the police,
anyone know about this place?

504

- [townspeople] Yes.
- Uh, I-I really wanted to.

505

- Oh. Are you fucking kidding me?
- [all murmuring]

506

- Watch your mouth.
- [woman 1] Come on.

507

- [woman 2] That could be it.
- Um, you don't understand.

508

They... they wouldn't
have believed me.

509

Tabitha, you don't know that.

510

Look. [grunts] All due respect,
when she told me,

511

I thought she was
out of her mind.

512

But you believed her.
Eventually, you believed her.

513

To be fair, my circumstances

514

are a little different
than the average person.

515

Look.
I-I was in the ambulance

516

when she was begging us
to turn around,

517

and we thought
she was hysterical.

518

What is she even doing here?

519

- She killed someone last night.
- [all] Yeah.

520

- All right. Oh, hey, hey!
- Come on!

521

Hey! Look.
That was an accident.

522

- [woman] Accident?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

523

Everything's an accident
unless it's somebody that you

524

and Queen Bee here don't like.

525

[Clara] I'm sorry to say this,
but you had an opportunity

526

that none of us have ever had
before, and you blew it.

527

- [woman 1] Yeah.
- [woman 2] Wow.

528

- Excuse me.
- We're just waiting here.

529

What exactly would you
have done, huh?

530

What would any of you have done?

531

- Hey.
- [Dale] Well, I wouldn't have

532

taken a day trip to the park.

533

- [woman] Yeah. Something.
- That's not what it was.

534

- I wasn't taking a day trip.
- [Fatima] You were out there

535

in the real world
where people can help.

536

How could you not take
advantage of that?

537

- [man] Right.
- Yeah, they may have thought

538

you were crazy,
but what if they didn't?

539

What if somebody believed you?

540

Well, someone believed me,
and look where he is!

541

He's sitting right here with us!

542

- Tabitha.
- Look. I'm sure everyone

543

could have done
a better job than what I did,

544

and I'm so sorry you didn't
have that opportunity.

545

I'm sorry I don't have
your answers.

546

I'm... I'm sorry.

547

I... I can't do this.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

548

- [woman] Tabitha, please.
- [Dale] Oh, come on!

549

Not now.
That's enough.

550

- I can't.
- Oh, my God.

551

Hey, listen. Listen.

552

The most important part
of all of this...

553

- [door closes]
- ...the thing that we cannot

554

lose sight of is
Tabitha got out.

555

For all the good
it seems to have done.

556

No, no, but it's...
it's not about the fact

557

that she is back here.

558

It's that someone got home.

559

It's not just hoping
and wishing anymore.

560

We have concrete proof now.
It's possible.

561

Great. Where's the tree?

562

- What?
- [woman] Really.

563

Where... is... the... tree?

564

[townspeople] Yeah!

565

Everybody just calm down.
Slow down for a second.

566

We gotta think about this, okay?

567

Well, what is there
to think about?

568

Tabitha went through the tree
and got home, right?

569

Why aren't we all lining up
to do the same?

570

Because it's not
that simple, okay?

571

We can't just run out there
into the forest

572

and hop into the first tree
that we see!

573

Why not?

574

Wha... Excuse me?

575

[Fatima] I just...
I... I'm sorry, Boyd.

576

I don't wanna be here a second
longer than I have to be.

577

Even... even if there is
the slightest chance

578

that this tree can get us home,
what are we waiting for?

579

- Okay. Everybody just...
- [Ellis] No, no, no.

580

Dad, Dad, she's right, okay?

581

We can't just sit here and talk
all day...

582

Okay! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
No! Listen! Hey, hey, hey!

583

You're all assuming that this
tree is some kind of magic door.

584

It's not.

585

I went through one
of those trees,

586

and you know where I ended up?

587

In a chimney underground.

588

Damn near killed myself.

589

- Look.
- You don't...

590

It wasn't even the tree
that got her out of here.

591

She said it was the lighthouse.

592

Great. Let's just
get to the lighthouse,

593

and then we'll go home.

594

- Listen to me, okay?
- No, you fucking listen!

595

- Dale, come on!
- No, no, no! I've had it!

596

I've had it!
Had it with your... plans.

597

I've had it
with your fucking rules!

598

I wanna go home!

599

[all murmuring]

600

[indistinct conversations]

601

Why didn't you go
to the meeting?

602

[liquid pours, clatter]

603

One thing you'll learn
when you're older,

604

any meeting with more than three
people is basically pointless.

605

[door opens]

606

- [Tabitha] Jade?
- That was quick.

607

[door closes]

608

[Jade] How'd it go?

609

[Jim] Uh, uh...

610

Huh?

611

Not great.

612

See?

613

We're going to the tree.

614

- Finally.
- Wait. What?

615

I have nothing to tell them,
Jim. They're right.

616

I went out. I went out,
and I came back.

617

And I came back with nothing.

618

I owe it to them.

619

[scoffs] You <i>owe?</i>

620

- Yes.
- Tabitha, you just got back,

621

and now you wanna
go back out there?

622

It's not like she's
gonna go in the tree.

623

- Exactly.
- Would you just stay outta this?

624

- I wanna go, too.
- No! Nobody is going to a tree.

625

Jim!

626

- I need to speak with you...
- Yeah.

627

...for a minute, please.

628

[sighs]

629

You need to think
about what you're doing.

630

- I am.
- [scoffs]

631

We thought you were dead.

632

Your children thought
you were dead.

633

You think I give a shit
about what you owe

634

to these people in a diner?

635

You owe it to your kids
to be here now.

636

I'm just gonna show him
where the tree is.

637

That's all.
I'm not gonna go in.

638

I'll be back. I promise.

639

Fine, but Ethan...
he stays here with me.

640

Do you know he ran off looking
for you when you were gone?

641

Do you really wanna
take him out there

642

and show him where the...
the magic tree is?

643

- Okay.
- Yeah.

644

- Okay.
- Okay.

645

Ethan, you're gonna stay here
with your father, okay?

646

- But I wanna help.
- You're helping by staying here.

647

I'll be back soon. Let's go.

648

I'll get my coat.

Dad.

652

Hey!

653

Stop, Dad!

654

Come on. Hey! Hey!

655

What the fuck is wrong with you?

656

- What?
- We are sitting

657

on a powder keg in there,

658

and you and Fatima
are lighting matches.

659

- She's upset.
- Oh, yeah?

660

Well, guess what?
We're all fucking upset.

661

What we need to do
is calm people down.

662

Okay, or maybe what we need is
for someone around here

663

to start doing something
instead of sitting around

664

worrying about what
could go wrong.

665

Is that what I'm doing?
I'm just...

666

I'm just sitting around.
Is that it, huh?

667

Maybe what we need is
to start taking chances.

668

Oh, you wanna take
some chances. Okay.

669

Who... who... who you
wanna take a chance on?

670

Whose life are you willing
to take a chance to gamble on?

671

You know that's not
what I'm saying.

672

No, no! Tell me,
'cause I wanna know!

673

Who we gonna march
out there next?

674

Huh? Huh?

675

You wanna do something, right?
So tell me! Who's next?

676

Who's your pick?!

677

Exactly.

678

What happened in there...
is a dangerous thing.

679

It's a dangerous...

680

I never realized
all this stuff was down here.

681

Yeah. Uh,
this is where they store

682

the surplus of weird.

683

Oh. Uh, I couldn't
sleep one night,

684

and, uh, I found this.

685

Oh, my God.

686

Oh. This is, like...

687

It's, like,
the vintage motherlode.

688

Oh, no. No. It's not
just vintage.

689

This shit is, uh...

690

This is '80s vintage.

691

Can you imagine people
running through the woods

692

in, like, fluorescent spandex?

693

With their big-ass hair
getting caught in the branches?

694

[laughs]

695

Oh. Hold on.

696

Oh. Oh, no way.

697

[chuckles]

698

Wait. Wait.

699

Like, come on.

700

Hey. Yeah. Hey, that's it.
That's it right there.

701

[laughs] Yeah, right?

702

Hey, check this out.

703

[laughs] Yeah. We're very
post-apocalyptic chic.

No. Don't do that.

715

No. You got one
for yourself.

716

Hey. Elgin.

717

[laughing] Come on.
Please?

718

- You have to come get it, then.
- That's not fair.

719

[laughter]

720

- [door opens]
- [Acosta] Sheriff Boyd?

721

You got a second?

722

I wanted to thank you
for what you said in there.

723

[sighs]
I can't take back what I did.

724

I know that,
but I think I can help.

725

Oh, yeah? How's that?

726

The meeting today...

727

Look, if you want them
to stop focusing on that tree,

728

you have to give them
something else to focus on,

729

a project or...

730

We had this really big storm.

731

It hit the coast last year,

732

and it flooded half the town,

733

knocked out all the power.

734

And people were scared.
They were angry.

735

And so the precinct captain,

736

he got everyone out
to sandbag the marina.

737

Now, the worst of the storm
had already passed,

738

but it gave people... it gave them
something to focus on.

739

It made them feel like they
had some sort of control.

740

I see.

741

So, you've been here
less than a day,

742

and already,
you've got the solution.

743

That's not what
I'm saying. I'm just...

744

You think I stuck up
for you in there?

745

You think we're buddies now?

746

The one thing I agreed to
was that you didn't belong

747

- in that goddamn room.
- What happened last night...

748

- You killed someone!
- I...

749

And you left two people to die
in that ambulance.

750

- I know!
- One of whom

751

you handcuffed
to a fucking wall!

752

- I am sorry.
- Great!

753

Go be sorry, then.
Try not to kill anybody.

754

You let me worry about how
to take care of my goddamn town.

755

Thank you!

Down in the tunnels.

I went down there the day you...

876

I was hoping to find
something to help Julie.

877

Instead, I saw this.

878

Turns out it wasn't a symbol.
It was a hole in the ceiling,

879

and these slashes were roots.

880

Huh.

881

And those kids... they were
laid out on slabs of stone,

882

repeating that word
over and over again.

Anghkooey.

When I tell you
I felt fear in that moment

like I've never felt
in my life...

But there was also this...
this glimpse

887

of something that... that I knew
was there but I couldn't...

888

even with all
the fucking horror,

889

it was like, for the first time,

starting to connect.

These numbers in these bottles,

898

they might seem like this tree.

There is no denying
what this tree did,

900

and the fact that
someone took the time

901

to put these bottles here,

902

to put <i>these</i> numbers here...
