[Boyd] <i>Previously on</i> From...

2

- Get them off me!
- Are you looking for these?

3

Take them.
We get to keep Randall, though.

4

We're gonna need
some fresh towels!

5

- No, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey. Stop!

6

- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- You fucking left me!

7

Ellis, he's so happy.

8

I can't tell him
how scared I am.

9

I'm trying to be patient,
but I-I need...

10

- You can't help!
- I don't understand.

11

This!

12

- It's all I can keep down!
- What?

13

I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

14

- What's wrong?
- Nothing for Christopher.

15

[Sara] Who was Christopher?

16

[Victor] He was our friend.

17

But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

18

and then everyone died.

19

[screams]

20

Jasper's the one who can
tell us why it happened.

21

Easier to tell myself
they were dead.

22

All that time,
my little boy was here.

23

What kind of man
gives up on his family?

24

Victor.

25

I didn't know how to get home.

26

What the hell
happened last night?

27

Boyd?

28

Tabitha's back.

29

What?

30

Boyd said you went
through a tree?

31

They're called Farway trees.

32

Can you get back there
without the tree?

33

I don't know.
I don't... I don't know.

34

What about the bottles?
Was there anything

35

- special about them?
- I took a few of 'em down.

36

There were slips of paper inside

37

with numbers written on them.

38

When you were out there,
did you contact anyone?

39

You don't understand,
they wouldn't have believed me.

40

You had an opportunity that
none of us have ever had before,

41

and you blew it.

42

I went out and I came back.

43

- And I came back with nothing!
- We thought you were dead.

44

Your children thought
you were dead.

45

You owe it to your kids
to be here now.

46

[breathing restlessly]

47

What are you doing?

48

I had a nightmare.

49

[sighs]

50

You wanna talk about it?

51

No.

52

Well, come back to bed.

53

[sighs]

54

I should've done more.

55

When I was out there,
I should've done more.

56

[exhales]

57

You did the best you could.

58

How do you know that?

59

What?

60

You keep saying stuff like that.
How do you know?

61

How do you have any idea
what I could've done?

62

I'm just...

63

You keep saying stuff like that,

64

just... that is not true,
just so I feel better.

65

I don't... I don't understand.

66

[sighs]

67

Would you... would you rather
I just picked you apart?

68

[sighs]

69

Make you feel like shit?

70

I'm not gonna do that.

71

I just want you to be honest!

72

No.

73

What you want

74

is for me to read your mind,

75

so I can say to you
whatever you wanna hear

76

at any given time.

77

You want me to be the bad guy?

78

Fine! But I was the one
who stayed here,

79

holding our kids together,
while you ran off

80

- to try to deal with whatever...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

81

- ...it was you were doing!
- You make it sound like

82

I went on a fucking vacation.

83

I came to you.

84

I asked for your
fucking permission.

85

I was just trying
to save our daughter.

86

Did it ever occur
to you that maybe

87

we could've
done things together?

88

No! Because you wanted
to do it on your own!

89

You want to do
everything on your own!

90

That's why you...

91

That's why what?

92

- No.
- That's why what?

93

Nothing.

94

Noth... that's why what?

95

I'm going back to bed.

96

Stop being a fucking
coward and tell me!

97

That's why you wanted a divorce,

98

because it'd be easier
for you to cut and run,

99

to deal with Thomas's
death on your own,

100

instead of trying
to put our family back together!

101

Oh, yeah and you were the knight
in shining armor, right?

102

Everything you did, every choice
you made was perfect!

103

- I never said that.
- You think getting the divorce

104

was gonna let me
deal with it on my own?

105

I was already on my fucking own!

106

Oh, that's so not true.

107

You got to throw
yourself into your work!

108

You were not there when Julie
and Ethan woke up crying.

109

You didn't see them

110

sitting in Thomas's room,
just staring at his toys...

111

No.

112

And you're upset.

113

You're upset because you had to

114

take care of your children
the few days that I was gone?

115

I took care of my fucking kids
for a year, while you were...

116

- No! God...
- ...I don't know fucking what.

117

- Damn it, no!
- [screeching in distance]

118

[screeching]

119

Where are you going?

120

[Jim] Downstairs!

146

Hey.

147

You slept late.

148

Where's Dad?

149

Um, he went to the lake
with some people

150

to get the rest of the food.

151

He left?

152

Yeah.
He's coming back tomorrow.

153

Go tell Ethan
I'm making breakfast.

154

So we're just taking
day trips to the lake now?

155

Honey, the people need the food.

156

Right.

157

And it had nothing to do with
that screaming match last night?

158

I'm sorry you heard that.

159

I'm pretty sure people
in Colony House heard.

160

Listen, Julie...

161

No. I get it.

162

I've heard this speech
plenty of times.

163

[exhales]

164

I'm just glad some things are
finally getting back to normal.

165

I'll get Ethan.

166

[Boyd] So you're saying
this could be some kind of code?

167

Yeah, or an algorithm,
or... who knows?

168

Look, the fact is, Tabitha got
pushed out of a lighthouse

169

and somehow ended up near
a hiking trail in Camden, Maine.

170

I don't think I'm being
controversial when I say,

171

by all known metrics,

172

that's impossible.

173

- Okay.
- Unless... Unless...

174

she experienced some kind
of... quantum event.

175

Right? Or wormhole, or any
number of theoretical events

176

that would allow her to get from
the lighthouse in the woods

177

to Camden, Maine.

178

Or maybe...

179

Maybe the lighthouse in the
woods occupies the same space

180

as Camden, Maine.

181

Maybe it wasn't a wormhole
so much as a dimensional rift!

182

- Jade.
- I can understand an awful lot

183

of people get confused,
but the truth is

184

a wormhole is a shortcut
through space and time.

185

- Whereas a dimensional rift...
- Jade, stop!

186

Sorry. What?

187

I thought you said you had
something exciting to show me.

188

Yeah.

189

All right,
okay, okay, listen, listen.

190

I understand why
you might be skeptical.

191

I am too.

192

Something tells me that
this has to mean something.

193

The bottle tree was
important to Miranda, right?

194

And according to Tabitha,
she's the only one

195

who had a connection to this
place long before she arrived.

196

Did you look at the bottles
from the other tree?

197

What other tree?
The one in Maine?

198

- No. How could I...?
- No, the one...

199

[sighs]
Sara and I found

200

one of these trees when we went
out into the woods together.

201

It wasn't a portal tree,

202

but it still had
bottles hanging from it,

203

messages inside.

204

I pulled one down,
it said... "1864."

205

1864.

206

Eighteen. Eighteen six...

207

I saw it.
[muttering]

208

Uh...

209

"1864."

210

Where's the second tree?

211

[wheel creaking]

212

[footsteps approaching]

213

Hey. Sorry.

214

I was looking for you
and I just figured I'd wait.

215

Okay.

216

I haven't seen
one of these in a long time.

217

Yeah. That belonged
to Mrs. Davis.

218

Is that right?

219

What was Mrs. Davis doing
with one of these?

220

She bought it for her son,

221

he was very sick,

222

and he saw the car
in the back of a magazine.

223

And so, she drove far away

224

to buy one from the only store

225

that still sold them.

226

- [tin rattling]
- Uh...

227

She...

228

She said her son
didn't have very long,

229

and she knew that
the car would make him...

230

smile.

231

She saw the tree
before she got home.

232

And she died a long time ago.

233

I guess her son is dead too.

234

Yeah, I was thinking maybe

235

you could show me around today.

236

Uh, there's something
I have to do.

237

It's very important.

238

Oh. Mind if I tag along?

239

No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

240

Right.

241

Well, I'll...
I'll just get out of your way.

242

Uh...
[exhaling sharply]

243

Uh, it's...

244

very... dangerous,

245

what I have to do, and I...

246

and I don't want
you to get hurt.

247

But you could walk with me
for a bit, if you want.

248

All right. I'd like that.

249

Okay.

250

I, uh, finished
cleaning out the ambulance.

251

Here's the last of it.

252

Awesome. Thanks.

253

Oh, this stuff is
gonna be a godsend.

254

I'm gonna bring this downstairs.

255

Oh, I can give you a hand.

256

You've done plenty, really.

257

You should go home,

258

get some rest.

259

Thank you.

260

[exhales]

261

Coming or going?

262

Oh, I, uh... going.

263

You okay?

264

Yeah. You know, I...

265

I'm good.

266

Yeah.

267

- Kenny...
- I'm good.

268

I'm good, really.

269

I don't wanna
talk about it right now.

270

Okay. Yeah.

271

Yeah.

272

[grunting in pain]

273

[groaning]

274

[breathing heavily]

275

[groans]

276

[Kristi]
Boyd!

277

Shouldn't you be in bed?

278

I don't think you're one
to talk about taking it easy.

279

Well...

280

He's doing better.

281

Yeah. Yeah. I was...

282

I was just, uh...

283

Hey, that ambulance
came in fully stocked.

284

There was a portable
ultrasound onboard.

285

Really?

286

Yeah.
When you see Fatima,

287

tell her to come on by.

288

She can take a look
at her little nugget.

289

I'll do that.

290

Hey, look, don't mention
that I came by, okay?

291

Yeah, of course.

292

Right.

293

That's really good news,
the ultrasound.

294

Yeah.

295

Say something.

296

We have to go to Kristi.

297

No.
I can't do that.

298

I mean, there's gotta be some
sort of medical explanation.

299

How can there be?

300

Look, I don't...

301

I don't want
everyone looking at me

302

the way that you're
looking at me right now.

303

Like you're afraid of me.

304

No, no, I am...
I am not afraid of you.

305

Okay? And whatever is happening
is not your fault, okay?

306

I just...

307

I just...
I just wanna help you.

308

Maybe it'll just go away.

309

You know, maybe it'll
just go away on its own.

310

- And maybe...
- Baby...

311

Maybe it'll just stop.

312

[knocking]

313

Who is it?

314

It's Dad.
I, uh, got some good news.

315

Just... just a second.

316

Just a second.

317

Hey.

318

Hey, look at me.

319

Look,
I-I am just as scared as you.

320

Okay?
But we cannot do this alone.

321

[Boyd]
If it's a bad time...

322

No, it's fine.

323

Okay.

324

Hey. What's...

325

[sighs]

326

What's going on?

327

Come in.

328

[grunting]

329

Donna?

330

I heard about what happened.
I'm so sorry.

331

Were you two close?

332

[sighs]

333

He was a pain in my ass
for almost two years.

334

He had some
good moments, though.

335

Would have loved this;

336

me hauling these
fucking stones across town.

337

Only thing
he would've liked better,

338

is if I left him to rot,

339

so he could ruin everyone's
breakfast every morning.

340

[chuckling mirthlessly]

341

I was there
when he went through.

342

He was just trying
to help, you know?

343

I'm sure he had some shitty
remark on his way out.

344

[chuckles]

345

You doing okay?

346

Yeah, yeah.

347

That meeting yesterday
couldn't have been too easy.

348

Well, I just...

349

I just feel that...

350

everyone expects me to have
all the answers, you know?

351

I feel like I let them down.

352

I feel like
I let my family down.

353

Let them down?

354

Tabitha, your children
thought you were dead!

355

They don't need
answers from you.

356

They just needed you back.

357

Yeah.

358

What if the people from
the meeting were right?

359

What if I wasted

360

the only opportunity
we're gonna get?

361

You see Dale down there?

362

You went through that same tree.

363

That could have been
you down there.

364

I know.

365

Don't try to be a hero.

366

Go spend time with your kids

367

because you're lucky
to be here still.

368

Don't take that for granted.

369

I'm done.

370

Hey.

371

I'm sorry about your friend.

372

Well, back to work.

373

Yeah.

374

You, uh...

375

tell those kids of yours
I said hello.

376

I will.

377

So you... you wanna
go down into the tunnels,

378

where these things live?

379

I don't want to.
I have to.

380

Because there's
something down there

381

that is going to help people?

382

It's going to save them.
It'll save you too.

383

We're here.

384

You should go now.

385

Do you remember the way back?

386

I'm... I'm not going back.

387

I'm, uh, coming with you.

388

No, that's not a good idea.

389

No. I just got you back.

390

I'm not losing you again.

391

If you're gonna do this,
we're doing it together.

392

Okay.

393

What... what are
those for?

394

So we don't get lost.

395

Follow close.

396

Hey, and be really,
really quiet.

397

I mean, we've seen things here
that... that don't make sense.

398

And...

399

these... these cravings,
maybe it's just...

400

I mean, may...
maybe it's just the effect

401

that this place has
on pregnancy,

402

so it doesn't have to mean
that there's something wrong

403

with the baby, right?

404

Right.

405

Right.

406

Kristi has
an ultrasound machine.

407

Wait. What?

408

It was on the ambulance
that came into town.

409

That's what I came to tell you.

410

No. I-I don't...
I don't... I don't wanna.

411

Could you give us a second?

412

Oh, yeah, of course.

413

Yeah.

414

Fatima...

415

Ellis, I don't want to see it.

416

No, we can't...

417

We cannot just hope

418

that this gets better, okay?

419

- I know.
- Okay.

420

We are in the dark.

421

I know. We'll do it tomorrow.
We'll go tomorrow.

422

Fatima, Fatima...

423

- I just want it to be okay.
- I know.

424

Hey, hey, it's okay.

425

I just want it to be okay.

426

I know, baby.

427

[sobbing]
I'm sorry.

428

Okay. I know.

429

[sobbing]

430

[sighs]
Good, you're awake.

431

The fuck do you want?

432

We need to change your bandages.

433

It's fine.

434

I need to make sure
there's no infection.

435

That's not something you want,
not here.

436

Fine.
I'll fuckin' change 'em.

437

I need you to sit up.

438

Please. Come on.

439

Yeah.

440

- [gasps]
- Okay, yeah.

441

[grunts]

442

[groans]

443

May I?

444

Yeah.

445

Well?

446

Um, there's
no sign of infection.

447

And the stitches are
holding well.

448

There's gonna be a lot of
bruising, a lot of discomfort.

449

I wanna see it.

450

Give me a minute?

451

Yeah, take your time.

452

[breathing unsteadily]

453

Hey.

454

[chuckles]
What are you doing?

455

You're not gonna
tell my parents, are you?

456

If you get caught,
I was never here.

457

- Deal.
- Okay.

458

You want some?

459

Don't push it.

460

Hey, I was... I was looking
for the screwdriver.

461

My mom always kept
a junk drawer in the kitchen.

462

Um, yeah.

463

My dad gets fidgety
when he's nervous,

464

so he probably
just moved stuff around.

465

Oh. Um, okay.

466

Um, God, no, I... I'm sorry.

467

With my mom being gone,
he probably didn't even realize.

468

No, it's fine. It's just a...
it's just a junk drawer.

469

I'm sorry.

470

It's not a big deal, seriously.

471

Um, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna
go check the dining room.

472

You just keep
that under wraps. 'Kay?

473

Okay.

474

Oh God.
[sighs]

475

[whispering]
How much further?

476

Shh!

477

This way.

478

[gasps]

479

No, he...

480

He should be here.

481

This is where I saw him.

482

This whole chamber was full.

483

Now it's not.

484

Maybe we took a wrong turn.

485

No.

486

Jasper,
he was sitting right here.

487

There was a clock
and a wheelchair.

488

And the bad things,
they were sleeping.

489

Hey, maybe we should go back.

490

You can get your bearings.

491

I know where I am.

492

We need to go deeper.

493

I'm not sure that's a good idea.

494

- We can't leave without Jasper.
- Victor.

495

It's important.

496

We'll be okay.

497

This way.

498

[door opening]

499

She's coming.

500

She just, uh...

501

She just needs a minute.

502

[Elgin] Thanks.

503

Hey, smile.

504

What?

505

Me and Julie found this
in the basement.

506

I figured we should put together

507

a little
Colony House photo album.

508

Doesn't have to all
be scary and bad.

509

Okay.

510

I'm gonna put
a collage on the wall,

511

if you wanna check it out later.

512

[door opening]

513

You ready?

514

I don't wanna say anything...

515

to Kristi,

516

not until we have to.

517

Okay.

518

You're coming, right?

519

Whatever you guys need.

520

All right.

521

[birds squawking]

522

[exhales]

523

Great.
[sighs]

524

[Tom] And then there were two.

525

Oh, for fuck's sake!
[sighs]

526

It's ironic, no?

527

A drunk looking for answers
in a tree filled with bottles.

528

[chuckles]

529

Why... why are
you wiping that glass?

530

A man does what a man does.

531

So, you really think this is
gonna tell you anything?

532

I think this place has a design.

533

Ah.

534

I don't think
anything's here by accident.

535

Maybe that's your problem.

536

And what, dead Tom,
does that mean?

537

Well, nature has a design, Jade,

538

and that is not nature.

539

It's just something
somebody put there.

540

Sure, it might mean
something, yeah.

541

Maybe it's something
someone made

542

because they thought
it meant something.

543

Maybe it's someone like you...

544

...just looking for answers,
trying to figure things out.

545

Grasping at straws.

546

And here you are, standing,
looking at this bottle tree,

547

puzzling over it like it's
a part of the original design.

548

No.
[chuckles]

549

See, Miranda had visions
of this place.

550

She had visions of these trees.

551

You don't have visions

552

about things
that don't mean anything.

553

What about the things you see?

554

The Civil War soldiers?

555

The guy crushed by the rock
in the root cellar?

556

No, no, no. Listen,
those were different.

557

Okay? Those were
completely different.

558

How so, Jade?

559

Fine! All right, fine!
Maybe it's garbage.

560

Maybe this is
a giant waste of time.

561

Are you gonna help me
bring these down or what?

562

I gotta finish this first.

563

Oh, for fuck's sake...

564

Jade. You mad?

565

I am a little bit annoyed, yeah!

566

You should work on that.

567

Because the Jade that built
a multi-million-dollar company

568

when everyone said he shouldn't,

569

that guy had
thicker skin. Yeah.

570

You really wanna
beat this place?

571

Maybe you should sober up

572

and give that guy a call.

573

There's a nicer way
to make your point, you know!

574

[door opening]

575

[door closing]

576

Hey, buddy.

577

What ya got there?

578

It's Tian Chen's.

579

Oh.

580

[chuckles]

581

Did you learn to read Chinese
while I was gone?

582

No.

583

Where's your sister?

584

She went for a walk.

585

Do you think Tian-Chen's
with her husband now?

586

I hope so.

587

Do you think they were happy
when they got married?

588

Honey...

589

I'm so sorry you heard us
fight last night.

590

I'm so sorry.

591

We're just trying
to do our best...

592

for all of us.

593

I liked it better
when we first got here.

594

Everyone was so scared,
there was no time to be angry.

595

I wish it could be
like that again.

596

What's Jade doing at the bar?

597

That's what you guys were
fighting about, right?

598

[exhales]

599

Jade, um...

600

he's... he's trying
to figure out a puzzle.

601

What kind of puzzle?

602

Is someone upstairs?

604

No.

That all I get?"

Well...

it's not just rocks.
It's dignity.

Everyone deserves that.

641

Yes, they do.

642

You don't have
to be here, honey.

643

You've already been
through enough of this.

644

Uh, actually,
I was kinda wondering

645

if you maybe had some extra
space up at Colony House.

646

For me.

647

She was the only thing
that ever made that house

648

feel like a home.

649

It was meant for a family.
She'd want them to have it.

650

We always have room for you.

651

You're not still throwing
those sex parties up there,

652

are you? 'Cause I...

653

Oh, just go pack your stuff

654

before I change my mind.

655

Yes, ma'am.

656

There we go.

657

[exhales]

658

Can we come in?

659

I'm a little busy.

660

Well, I told Ethan we can...

661

we can help you
with your puzzle.

662

Uh, sure. Yeah.

663

You like puzzles, buddy?

664

Yeah.

665

Well, great, 'cause this one

666

just got a whole lot
more interesting.

667

How?

668

Turns out there is
a second bottle tree.

669

- There's two of them?
- Mm-hmm.

670

Not only that, but the messages
in the bottles, the numbers,

671

they're all the same.

672

I mean, the placement's
obviously different,

673

and in the second tree,
they're written out in cursive.

674

But the actual numbers,

675

you line them up side by side;
they are exactly the same.

676

Not to mention some of them
repeat, over and over again.

677

What does that mean?

678

I have no idea.

679

But I am increasingly optimistic
that, somewhere in here,

680

somewhere in these dates,
in these numbers,

681

is a key to something
that we need to understand.

682

You wanna help me find it?

683

Okay.

684

You need to apply this every
time you change the bandages.

685

I heard you the first time.

686

That gets infected,
you're gonna be in a world of...

687

I said I heard you.

688

Okay.

689

You're all set, then.

690

Why are you pretending
you're okay?

691

If you're talking
about Nicky, that was...

692

No, you know
what I'm talking about.

693

Just make sure
you change the bandages.

694

You can pretend all you want,

695

but you were there,

696

same as me.

697

What if it's not over?

698

Whatever happened to us,
it wasn't...

699

What?

700

It wasn't real?

701

What the fuck is "real" anymore?

702

Ah, it's gotta be easy for you

703

in a place like this,
though, huh?

704

Going to sleep next
to somebody every night.

705

You get to pretend
that you're okay.

706

Yeah, well, it's not
like that out on the bus.

707

I don't get to pretend.

708

It's fucking...

it gets too loud sometimes.

786

I used to hide here...

787

...before the people came.

788

At night?
You would hide in here?

789

Uh-huh.

790

Because you were alone.

791

That means
that we can save people.

796

How?

He knows things.

798

Yeah.

I heard him tell Christopher
a story about this place once,

800

and we have to make him
tell it again.

801

But Victor...
Victor...

802

that's a toy.

803

We'll make him tell it again.

804

You'll see.

805

Okay.
Let's lift this up.

806

[Marielle]
I got the gel.

807

Oh, great. Thank you.

808

All right, so,
it's just gonna be a bit cold.

809

Now, keep in mind,
it's still early days,

810

so it's not gonna
look like much yet.

811

It'll be about
the size of an acorn,

812

and if we're lucky,
we might see the arms and legs.

813

So, just, keep your
expectations in check, okay?

814

Okay.

815

Ready?

816

Okay.

there's your uterus.

820

What's going on?

I, um...
Hm.

822

I don't see anything.

823

What...
what do you mean?

824

Um...

825

You're not pregnant.

826

No, no, that's...
that's impossible.

827

I need you to keep looking.

- [Fatima] You barely looked!

829

- Just keep looking!
- Sweetie, I'm so sorry...

I don't need you to be sorry!

- [Ellis] Hey, it's okay.

832

- It's not okay!

833

Okay, we'll take
a look together, okay?

834

It's okay.

All right.

So right here is where
the baby's supposed to be.

But there's nothing there.

No, I...

There's something inside of me.
I need you to find it.

- Are you all right?

850

You look weird.

851

I'm fine.

852

I like the collage.

853

The fact that some
of the numbers repeat,

854

that means there's
a pattern somewhere.

855

The 2 on this one's backwards.

856

Mm-hmm.

857

Same thing with
the number seven,

858

but they're only
backwards sometimes.

859

- Why?
- I don't know.

860

That's why we have
to figure out the pattern.

861

If we can
figure out the pattern,

862

then we can
figure out the shape.

863

Get cracking.

864

Look...

865

whatever those kids are,
they're not gonna hurt you.

866

How do you know that?

867

They want your help, right?

868

I don't know. Maybe.

869

I'm basing that on
something a dead woman saw

870

in a vision 40 years ago, so...

871

[sighs]

872

What is this?

873

Some wards scattered
around the settlement.
