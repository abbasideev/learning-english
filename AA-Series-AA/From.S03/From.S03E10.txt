[Boyd] <i>Previously on</i> From...

3

Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

4

Well, I don't think
that's the worst thing

5

that can happen to you here.

6

<i>When I blacked out in the ruins,</i>

7

<i>it was almost like
I went somewhere.</i>

8

<i>And then I heard those children.</i>

9

- They were screaming that word.
- Anghkooey.

10

[Jade] <i>The bottle tree
was important to Miranda.</i>

11

<i>She had visions of these trees.</i>

12

Somewhere in these numbers
is a key

13

to something
that we need to understand.

14

There is no baby.

15

Yes, there is.
It's just not yours.

16

[Fatima crying]
Elgin, please!

17

Fatima is missing.

18

[Donna] What we're asking for
is a search party.

19

What if Fatima is out
doing something to help us?

20

I think she's gonna be okay.

21

The last place we saw her
was out at the shack,

22

which is about here.

23

So, we've got people
covering this whole area

24

in and around town,
which leaves here, here.

25

What was she doing?

26

- What?
- [door opens]

27

Out at the... shack.

28

- Why was she out there?

29

Hey.

I think Elgin knows.

31

I think
he knows where Fatima is.

He said she was fine and that
this was all important.

70

He was so calm about it.

71

He said I shouldn't be afraid.

72

Look, I don't know
if he just snapped

73

or if something here
is actually talking to him.

74

Where is he now?

75

Colony House.

76

You two go up there.

77

And make sure he does not leave.

78

- Okay. What are you gonna do?
- Just go.

79

[door opens]

80

[Ethan] Do you think
they found Fatima yet?

81

[Jim] I sure hope so.

82

[door opens]

83

[clears throat]

84

- [Ethan] Victor.
- [Victor] Oh.

85

- What are you doing here?
- Your mom fell down.

86

What?

87

[door opens and closes]

88

Thank you, honey.

89

- What happened?
- Mm.

90

- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah?

91

- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

92

I saw the Boy in White.

93

Really?

94

Yeah.

95

What did he say?

96

- He wasn't very helpful.
- [door opens]

97

- Let's go to the diner.
- I don't want to.

98

Mom and Dad need to talk.
Come on.

99

- Wanna come?
- No.

100

Come on. I'm hungry.

101

The little girl... she led us
to the root cellar.

102

Victor was there.
He was really upset.

103

He remembered something
about his mother

104

and the night she left.

105

When I hugged him...

106

I felt like Miranda was there.

107

What do you mean?

108

I don't know how to explain it,

109

but I could feel her.

110

I could feel her in that room.

111

And then she took me back
to the night it happened,

112

the night she left her children,

113

the night she went to the tree.

114

So you had, like, a vision?

115

No. No, no, no, no, no.

116

It was not a vision.
It was more than that.

117

[sighs]
Somehow, Miranda was there,

118

and she was trying
to tell me something.

119

We're closed!

120

You're gonna wanna hear this.

121

[sighs]
No offense, Jim,

122

but I think I've heard
just about enough.

123

Look, I'm... I'm sorry

124

about the way I came
in here yesterday.

125

- I shouldn't have.
- [sighs]

126

I'm scared.

127

Things are happening
in my family

128

that I don't know how
to protect them from.

129

But the truth is,
I think you might.

130

I figured you might be here.

131

I need you to come up
to Colony House with me.

132

Elgin's been acting strange.

133

From what Ellis tells me,
the kid's been

134

under a lot of stress,

135

plus he and Tillie were close.

136

So, what happened
to her may have just...

137

Yeah. I don't know.
Anyway, he told Ellis

138

that Fatima and the baby

139

are gonna be the reason
we all get to go home.

140

Now, that sound familiar?

141

What do you need me to do?

142

I need you to talk to him,
make him understand

143

that if he really is
talking to something here,

144

its intentions aren't good.

145

You of all people
understand that, okay?

146

- Just remember...
- [door closes]

147

Hey.
What the hell's going on?

148

Ellis and Kenny are inside,
saying Elgin can't leave.

149

- Where's Acosta?
- She's still out looking.

150

I came back to see
if anyone found anything.

151

How many people you got inside?

152

I don't know. A few. Most people
are still out searching.

153

I need you to clear the house.

154

When she got
to the tree... [sighs]

155

...she was so close.

156

But one of these things
came from the woods and...

157

it smiled.

158

And you watched Miranda die.

159

You've had visions
before, right?

160

Not like this.

161

It's always more like
I'm seeing something

162

that shouldn't be there.

163

Like, that day that I saw
the Civil War soldier,

164

it's not like I was back
in the Civil War.

165

This is... this is different.

166

Look, you said
something interesting.

167

You said that it felt
like Miranda was trying

168

to tell you something.

169

- I know it sounds crazy.
- [Jade] No, it doesn't.

170

Not here, anyway.

171

[exhales deeply]

172

Okay. Um... [chuckles]

173

The first law of thermodynamics

174

is that energy can neither
be created nor destroyed.

175

It can only change
from one form to another.

176

And our thoughts,

177

our memories...

178

our souls,

179

if you believe
in that sort of thing,

180

they're made of energy.

181

And that energy...

182

Maybe here, that energy...
I don't know,

183

maybe it lingers.

184

All right, look, you... you said
it was one of those...

185

those creepy kids that led you
to the root cellar, right?

186

- Yeah, a little girl.
- [Jade] Okay.

187

Whatever it was
Miranda showed you,

188

those kids wanted you to see.

189

Where were you when you
saw the little girl?

190

Out by Victor's truck.

191

Elgin.

192

Mind if we talk
to you for a minute?

193

Yeah. Okay.

194

We'll go to my room.

195

- I'll take that.
- Yeah.

196

[Boyd] Just in there.

197

[Boyd clears throat]

198

Go on. Have a seat.

199

Have a seat.

200

Can you watch the door for me?

201

I mean, it looks like you, uh,

202

packed supplies
for a couple days.

203

Where were you going?

204

I was just...

205

[Boyd] Yeah.

206

I'm gonna ask you something,

207

and I want you
to tell me the truth.

208

Do you know where Fatima is?

209

- Elgin?
- Answer the question.

210

She told me not
to say anything. I just...

211

I know how much
you all care about her.

212

When you told me
about your mom...

213

I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

214

I wanted to help.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

215

But you have to understand,

216

what's happening is
a good thing.

217

Elgin, you said she told you
not to say anything. Who is she?

218

I know it sounds crazy,
but I think she's an angel.

219

- Elgin, there's...
- [Elgin] She's here to help us!

220

Something is happening here
that's beyond

221

our ability to understand,
like in the Bible.

222

People never really
understood then.

223

But they had faith,

224

even when it was hard,

225

especially when it's hard.

226

Fatima's baby is going
to save all of us.

227

Hey, Elgin, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

228

- There is no baby.
- That's not true.

229

Kristi and Marielle did
an ultrasound in the clinic.

230

And when they
pulled up the image,

231

there was nothing there.

232

Whatever's growing
inside her is not a child.

233

The things it's done to her,
the things it's made her do...

234

You don't understand.
She explained all that to me.

235

Wait. The angel?

236

Yes.

237

[Sara] Elgin.

238

The day we met, I...
told you I killed my brother.

239

Do you know why that happened?

240

There were voices here
that told me

241

if I killed a little boy,
we would all get to go home.

242

This place...

243

it doesn't give.

244

It takes.

245

And what it's doing to you...

246

But do you see how
it's different?

247

No one is dying here.

248

Fatima is gonna be fine.

249

You don't fucking know that,
okay? You don't know that!

250

Once the baby is born,
we all get to go home.

251

Elgin, even if she's pregnant,

252

that's still months away.

253

No. It's grown.

254

You should see Fatima's belly.

255

- Okay. Where the fuck is she?
- No, no, no! Hey!

256

- Where the fuck is she?
- I can't!

257

- Kenny!
- [all shouting at once]

258

- Kenny, Kenny!
- I'll fucking kill you!

259

- Where is she?
- I can't! I can't!

260

[Boyd] All right! All right!
Everybody out!

261

- Hey! Just relax!
- Out! Out! Outside!

262

[Boyd] Everybody, now!
Let's go!

263

No. He knows where
she is, all right?

264

- I can't just let him sit there!
- I know. I know. Just breathe.

265

No. I don't need
to fucking breathe!

266

- What I need is to find my wife!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

267

We're gonna find out
everything that he knows.

268

I just need you to calm down.

269

What he said about the baby,

270

about how big Fatima's gotten,
do you think it's true?

271

I don't know, Donna.

272

[Sara]
He's not gonna tell you!

273

I know what it's like to have
this place in your head.

274

If he really believes what he's
saying is gonna save everyone,

275

he's not gonna tell you
where she is.

276

Where do you keep your tools?

277

- Boyd.
- Where?

278

The shed.
They're in the shed.

279

Whoa. Boyd.

280

You stay by the door.

281

He doesn't come out.

282

No one...
goes back in that room.

283

[dramatic music playing]

284

Victor.

285

Uh, how are things
going with, uh, Jasper?

286

Did he say anything
interesting so far?

287

It's just a doll.
You were right.

288

Dolls don't talk.

289

Oh.

290

Look. I... [sighs]

291

I-I-I just wanted to say,

292

I'm sorry I haven't
been more help.

293

All this...
it's been a lot for me.

294

But that's no excuse.

295

- From now on...
- I have to show you something.

296

Okay.

297

It's gonna make you angry.

298

It's... it's gonna
make you hate me.

299

What?

300

But I have to show you.

301

And then we'll be done.

302

Uh, done with what?

303

It's this way.

304

Okay, okay, okay.

305

- You really gonna do this?
- [sighs]

306

I don't got time for you today.

307

What comes first?

308

You gonna use the saw
or the hammer?

309

Oh, you know what you should do?

310

You should go old school.

311

Get yourself some pliers and rip
his fingernails right off.

312

Well, if that's what it takes.

313

You really don't see
the irony, do you?

314

What the fuck are you
talking about?

315

Oh, I don't know.
When Fatima killed Tillie,

316

you didn't even blink.

317

I mean, you did everything
you could to protect her.

318

You took her out to the shed.

319

You lied to the people
you claim to care about.

320

Hell, Kenny's
in there right now.

321

He still doesn't
know what she did.

322

What happened wasn't her fault.

323

Okay, and tell me how that's
any different with Elgin.

324

I mean, this place
got inside his head,

325

made him think
he was doing something good.

326

Convinced him he was
actually protecting Fatima.

327

And now, you're out here getting
ready to go medieval on him.

328

Bit of a double standard,
don't you think?

329

It's different.

330

There's nothing
I could do about Tillie.

331

Oh, bullshit. Tell yourself
anything you want, Boyd.

332

I mean, you...
you walk around here

333

like you're some
big knight in shining armor,

334

Mr. Noble Sheriff.

335

Push comes to shove, you're no
different than anyone else.

336

You protect what's yours,
and you fuck anyone

337

who gets in your way. You were
supposed to be better than this.

338

Hey, you were
supposed to be here!

339

You were...

340

You and I were supposed
to figure this out together!

341

You were the one who went
in the fucking street

342

and got his throat slit!

343

So, don't you come in here
and judge...

344

You don't get to judge me.

345

I'm doing the best I can.

346

You know there's no coming
back from this, right?

347

You said that you weren't gonna
let this place break you.

348

But if you do this,

349

this place has won.

350

And if I don't... uh...

351

my daughter-in-law dies.

352

Well, that's why they call it
a rock and a hard place,

353

not a rock and a soft,
comfy pillow.

354

You need to decide right now
who you are,

355

because that's who you're
gonna be from now on.

356

Someone open this door!

357

Please! [sobbing]

[inhales sharply, groans]

365

[panting]

366

What are we doing here?

367

I thought maybe
there was a reason

368

they came out to you here.

369

Look. The only thing
tying together

370

all the crazy
that we've seen, right...

371

me, you, Miranda... the...
the one point of overlap

372

in all our Venn diagrams
of crazy...

373

Is the children.

374

Wait.
You've seen them too?

375

In the cavern.

376

They were laying on these...
these slabs of rock,

377

saying that word,
that "Anghkooey."

378

- Yeah.
- "Anghkooey,"

379

over and over again.

380

And I looked up.

381

There was this hole
in the ceiling.

382

And there was this mass
of... of... of roots,

383

this tangle forming
that fucking symbol.

384

The roots of the tree.

385

What'd you say?

386

The Boy in White...
Victor heard him.

387

He said when the kids
were on the stones,

388

they poured their hopes into
the roots that made the symbol,

389

and then those roots
became the tree.

390

Is it the bottle tree?

391

Uh, yeah, I think so.

392

Okay. So the, uh,
creepy kids

393

made a magic tree.

394

And the symbol that has been

395

plaguing me this whole time...
[chuckles]

396

[Jade laughing]

397

You could have just
fucking told me!

398

- You didn't have to...
- Jade. Jade.

399

No, no! I am sick...

400

I am sick and tired
of getting dicked around!

401

If you really want our help,

402

if there is something
you need us to understand,

403

you're gonna have
to do a little better,

404

because we are not getting it!

405

You hear me? Message is
not fucking received!

406

So, we're gonna sit here,
and we're gonna wait.

407

And when you decide

408

that you have
something more to say

409

than fucking "Anghkooey,"

410

you know where to find us!

411

You feel better now?

412

No. Not really.

422

You're not giving yourself
time to heal.

423

Well, Fatima's still out there.
I can't just sit here.

424

I'm gonna get some fresh gauze.

425

You were really quiet
last night,

426

after they brought Julie in.

427

I just felt bad.

428

- I mean, she's...
- [clattering]

429

Uh, Randall?

430

Hey, what happened
to your bandage?

431

It fell off.

432

Uh, where's the stuff from
the ambulance, the new stuff?

433

- It's in the cabinets.
- No, not the medicine.

434

The equipment.
Where did you put the equipment?

435

There's a supply closet
downstairs. We...

436

- Great.

469

What happens next...

470

that's on me.

471

Boyd.

473

Go downstairs now, Kenny.

474

We should talk to him again.

475

Look. He's a good kid,

497

Okay.

498

499

We're here.

500

We're here?

501

What is that?

502

I tried to make it pretty.

503

The way she would have liked it.

504

Hmm? Wait.

505

This is where I buried Mom.

506

I thought you'd want to see.

507

Oh, God.

518

There wasn't much left.

519

[breathing unsteadily]

520

It was my fault.

521

What?

522

I thought Jasper
told Christopher the secrets.

523

It wasn't Jasper.
It was the Boy in White.

524

I was wrong.
He told Christopher about...

525

about the children and the tree.

526

[crying] But I was the one
that told Mom.

527

[Victor crying]

528

I told her that the tree would
bring her to the children.

529

[sniffling] I was the reason
that she left that night, Dad.

530

- I was the reason that she died.
- Victor, you know...

531

If I'd just not said anything,

532

she would still be here,
and Eloise would still be here.

533

No. Victor,
you were just a boy. You...

534

I should have died
that night, too.

535

What?

536

And you should
pretend that I did.

537

You don't have to be
my dad anymore.

538

No. Wait. Stop.

539

Goddamn it! I said stop!

540

You don't ever say that again!

541

Do you hear me?!

542

You don't ever...

543

I'm your dad.

544

I will never stop
being your dad.

545

Your mother did what she did
because she loved you.

546

[Jade] Listen. If those
kids made the tree,

555

then those messages
in the bottles, the numbers,

556

they have to matter.

557

How do we know the numbers
mean anything?

558

We don't even know who
put them there.

559

I mean, think of all the people
who have been here.

560

We could be chasing
someone's random delusion.

561

No! Miranda knew
those bottles were important.

562

Why else would she have
a replica in her backyard?

563

She's right. Like, there's
something there. There has

564

- to be something there.
- Of course. There has to be.

565

All right. Okay.
There's ten numbers, right?

566

- Two are backwards?
- Yes, the two and the sevens.

567

Great.
So that means there's 12.

568

And believe me, I have tried

569

every mathematical,
astronomical, astrological,

570

cipher I can imagine.

571

The Zodiac, months of the year,
fucking eggs in a carton.

572

Bent over backwards twisting it

573

the Fibonacci sequence.

574

There's nothing there.
Believe me.

575

Aren't there
12 notes in a scale?

576

What'd you say?

577

Music.
My mom was a piano teacher.

578

She used to say that music
is the universal language.

579

I mean, there <i>are</i> 12 notes
in a scale, right?

580

A through G with
the flats and the sharp.

581

Tea Cup,
you are a fucking genius.

582

I love you. Uh, we need
to get to the bar.

583

You need to go to your house.

584

- Why?
- Victor's mother had a violin.

585

He hid it somewhere
in your basement.

586

- Why?
- Because I kept stealing it.

587

Just meet us at the bar.
Come on, people! Let's go!

588

- [door closes]
- How's he doing?

589

I gave him something
that should help him sleep.

590

Well, what are we gonna
do when he wakes up?

591

I mean, he tried to...

592

He had the paddle on his head.

593

I don't know.

594

Look. I've...
I've tried to be respectful,

595

and I've tried
to give you space,

596

but I just really need you
to talk to me right now.

597

598

Randall just tried
to lobotomize himself,

599

Julie is a mess, and you're
acting like everything's fine.

600

Hey. Look. I don't know what

601

to tell me if you're okay.

602

- Kristi.
- No.

604

605

Are you okay?

606

No, I'm not.

607

And I don't think any of us
are gonna be.

608

- Okay.
- Please, can you...

609

It was a picture of my house,

621

with my wife when I retired,

622

the one that we were going to

623

when I ran
into that fucking tree.

624

625

was the boat.

Well... we treat it
like any composition.

698

We try to figure out what is
a chord and what is a melody.

699

2, 9, 7, 5. 2975.

700

- The 2 is backwards.
- Mm-hmm.

701

So, that would be a G

702

instead of a B, okay,

703

followed by F sharp, D, E. Okay.

704

So, if it was a melody,
it would be something like...

When we went to those ruins,

I didn't just have a dream.

I think I went somewhere.

What do you mean?

788

I don't know how, but I...

When we went to the ruins,

chained to the wall.

I think that's where we were
when we couldn't wake up.

But then I left the chamber,

797

and I went into the tunnels.

798

I heard Mom's voice.

799

And she was talking to Victor.

Remember how she said
that Victor was the one

801

who helped her find her way
out of the tunnels

that night when the house
fell down?

- You can visit the chapters.

you were torturing that kid.

Jade was Christopher.

children and set them free...

was ours.
