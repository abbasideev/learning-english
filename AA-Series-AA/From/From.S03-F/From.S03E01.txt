Where am I?
Milad Hospital.


Three days ago, a pair of hikers found you in the woods.


You were lying unconscious on the side of a trail.


You said Milad
but where is this?


You're in Tehran


Can you tell me your name?


What?


You were found without any identification.


Can you tell me anything about what happened to you?


Where did you get those cuts and bruises?


Why don't you have a seat?


It's okay.


It's all right.


No one's gonna hurt you.


Is there someone we can call?


A family member?


No


The police are on their way.


Thank you.


Oh, why...


It's just a formality.


We all just want to make sure
you're okay, that's all.


Now that you're awake, I'd also like to run a few tests,


if you're feeling up to it.
Would that be all right?


I'm gonna step outside for a minute,


but I'll be right down the hall.


Sit tight and rest, all right?


Hey! Look where you're going!


What do you mean,
"It's the only way"?


Get your hands off him.


I'm so sorry.


What's wrong with you?


I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


Kristi's got other things on her mind.


She has to look after Marielle.


Right.


How are they, by the way...


Marielle, Randall, and Julie?


They seem fine.


What?


Well, the fact that you can look at anything right now


and describe it as "fine"


has a bewildering charm to it.


Yeah, well, we're still here, right?


One of your own people tried to kill you three days ago.


Half the town is still afraid to go to sleep,


you have a food shortage with no solution,


I'm not sure if you've noticed...


it's getting pretty cold outside.


Yeah, well, we got blankets.


Oh, right, yeah, I forgot about the blankets.


Never mind.
I guess we're fine then.


What do you want me to do?


Scream "fire"?
Get everybody panicked?


Maybe they aren't panicked enough.


Maybe you aren't panicked enough.


You know, when I was in that chamber,


that thing that was talking to me,


telling me to give up,


that hope is what the forest fed on...


that thing, whatever it was, it sure as hell wasn't my wife.


So, what are you?


I'm afraid I can't answer that for you,


No! Let me go!


We have to help her!
Stop! Let me go!


No! Let me go!


We've been looking everywhere for you.


You told them, didn't you?


Hey, I'm talking to you.


Why'd you tell them?


We have to go find Mom!


We can't just leave her out there!


We have to do something!


all right? Just go.


Dad!


You found him.


Good.


I'm gonna go for a walk.


Julie.


It's not your fault, Dad. None of this is your fault.


You know you can't do this.


I never should have let her go.
I'm not gonna just sit around.


you can't be in the woods overnight.


My son just tried to run away so that he could go look for her.


My daughter is still refusing to talk about


whatever happened to her when she,


My kids need their mom.


What am I supposed to do?


I don't know.
But it can't be this.


I already tried that, when I went into the woods with Sara,


You still made it back okay.


Yeah, by the skin of my goddamn teeth.


I'm not having this conversation.


Don't you fucking dare.


What's goin' on?


I'm gonna go look for my wife.


All right, wait,
just hold on a second.


If you're gonna go, there might be a safer way to do this.


Come on! You've been in there almost an hour already!


Just give me a second.


You said that 15 minutes ago!
Come on!


I can't wait any longer!


Hurry up!
What are you doing in there?


Back off, Nicky.


Eat shit, Clara.


Hey, is there a problem?


Yeah, there's a problem.
I'm about to piss on the floor.


Screw her.


You doing okay?


Yeah, I'm fine.


Baby, you really gotta eat something.


My stomach just hasn't been right.


I just gotta rest.


There's two of you I gotta worry about now.


I'll be okay.


The first couple of months can be hard,


Yeah.


she'll be all right.


Ellis, we've got work to do.


Isn't it too soon to harvest?


We've already lost half our crop to the storm.


I don't wanna risk losing what little we have left,


hoping the ground doesn't freeze.


Has he slept yet?


I don't know.


We got bigger things to deal with.


Round up some bodies.
Meet me out in the field.


we started out at the little stone hut


where I found the talismans.


We were also in a tent that got dragged who knows where.


But if you start out in the hut each morning,


you're at least starting closer to what you're trying to find,


and you've got a place to come back to at night,


so you don't get yourself killed.


Makes sense. Thanks.


Uh, wait. You said you and Sara both made camp in there?


Yeah. Why?


I'm gonna go with him.


Can I talk to you outside?


Oh, that's really cute.


Let me get one of the two of us.


would it be possible for me to borrow one of your phones?


Will you be quick?


Yeah.


Why would you do that?


Tabby? Oh, God! Tabby!
Where are you?


Mom, hi.
I'm okay. We're all okay.


Where have you been?


we had to go for a little while,


And you went where?


Tabby, the police are looking for you


I'm gonna tell you everything as soon as I see you.


We have been so worried!


I just wanted to hear your voice and for you to hear mine.


Mom, I love you so much,


Everyone says hello.


I can't stay here for long.


Why would you do that?


You seriously need to disinfect your phone now.
