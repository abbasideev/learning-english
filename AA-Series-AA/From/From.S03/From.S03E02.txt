- Where am I?
- You're in Camden, Maine.

Get the hell outta here.
You deaf? I said get the...

You're Victor's father.

8

I'm gonna go look for my wife.

Someone's gotta make sure that
Jim comes back in one piece.

10

I know what it's like
to lose a parent here,

11

and I'm not gonna watch
Julie and Ethan lose

12

both their parents
in the same week.

13

[in Cantonese]

14

Ma...

15

What the fuck?

16

These look pretty solid.

17

We could just start
from here in the morning.

18

- Just give me a second.
- [Nicky] Come on!

19

My stomach just
hasn't been right.

20

Those animals are the only food
that we have now.

21

They are a resource.
We have to make everything last!

22

There's goddamn cows
in the street!

23

Get those smaller animals
into the barn!

24

- [Ethan] Alma's outside!
- No! Go! Ethan, run!

25

- Julie!
- [Julie] Go!

26

- [muffled gasp]
- Shh!

27

[screams, howls]

28

- Let's go!
- [Boyd] Come on!

29

No, no, no! You go back!

30

- We do together!
- [grunts]

31

- [gasps]
- No!

32

Boyd!

33

You think this place
can't break you?

34

Let's see.

35

- [screaming and crying]
- What the fuck?!

36

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

37

No, no, no, no, no, no!

In my pocket.

[Jim, in distance] Kenny!

69

No. No.

70

[Jim]
You gotta come down here!

71

Look at this.

72

It's growing in patches
all around the lake.

73

There's enough food here to feed
everybody in the entire town.

74

Look.

What happened?

Oh, no. It's okay.

You, um...

102

You passed out
on my front porch.

103

Maybe...
maybe I should just...

104

You should sit.

105

Okay. Okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

106

You showed up on my doorstep

107

with the lunchbox
my son left here with...

108

...a very long time ago.

109

So, you're gonna tell me
how you found that,

110

and you're gonna
tell me right now.

111

Okay.

112

Yeah.

113

Okay. Um...

114

[sighs]

115

My name is Tabitha Matthews.

116

My family and I
were on a road trip

117

to see some
relatives in Colorado,

118

when we had to take
a detour off the highway.

119

There was a massive tree
in the middle of the road,

120

so we thought we were
just driving around it.

121

[cawing]

122

But we never
got back to the road.

123

We kept driving, and...
and we got to this... town,

124

a place that we couldn't leave.

125

But there were people there,

126

and some of them had
been there for a while.

127

I don't know how long
they'd been...

128

No, no! Where did you get
the lunchbox?

129

Well, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

130

The place we ended up,

131

there are people that had been
there for years, I mean, for...

132

Where did you get the lunchbox?!

133

- He gave it to me!
- Who?

134

Your son. Victor.
He... he gave it to me.

135

Oh. He gave it to you.

136

Yeah.

137

When?

138

Um...

139

- Three, four... Four days ago.
- [groans]

140

Victor is alive. The town
I was telling you about,

141

he's been stuck there
all these years.

142

Okay, all right. If, uh...

143

If you won't talk to me, then
maybe you'll talk to the police.

144

No, sir. Please, please.
You can't call them.

145

I can't tell them who I am.

146

If I try to explain any of this
to them, I'll sound crazy.

147

When they ask
where my family is...

148

what am I gonna tell them?
I don't...

149

I don't know where they are.

150

Please, sir,
you have to believe me.

151

- Please don't call the police.
- Well, Tabitha,

152

I called the police
about 20 minutes ago.

153

They should be here any minute.

154

So, we're just gonna
sit here together...

155

until they arrive.

156

I know how to prove
I'm not lying.

157

No. You don't come in here.
You understand?

158

Boyd might be okay
with everything you did,

159

but if you think for a second...

160

Tian-Chen died.

161

What?

162

Something happened last night.
The animals...

163

got out into the street,
and she...

164

I didn't... I thought
you would want to know,

165

and I wasn't sure if anyone...

166

I'm sorry.

Ethan...

She'll be more comfortable

Wait! Where are you going?

We can't help her! She's dead!

She's dead, Ethan!

That family...
that family's there, too.

You're lying. I-I...

249

I don't know how you're
doing this, but you're lying.

250

No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

251

I swear to you I'm not.

252

I swear on my children's lives.

253

My family is trapped,
and Victor is trapped, too.

254

Then how did you get here, huh?

255

You want me to believe you just
happen to be the one person

256

who somehow managed to escape
this terrifying place?

257

Listen, I don't understand,
but yes, yes.

258

And Victor helped me.

259

No, don't... [scoffs]

260

[sighs] Please.

261

Victor is a good man.

262

He's nice and sweet,
and my son loves him.

263

And my daughter...
He saved my daughter's life.

264

I thought that

265

if I saved the children
locked in the tower, then...

266

somehow, I could save her from
whatever's happening to her...

267

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What did you say?

268

Well, when I was in town,
I started seeing children,

269

or at least imagining I was.

270

And they were
really frightening.

271

Victor said that they were
children locked in the tower,

272

that if I saved them,
then maybe I could...

273

I could somehow help my daughter
from what she's going through,

274

and I don't know
if I'm doing it...

Henry, you in there?

I thought I had an intruder

and turned out to be
just a dog off the leash.

Look, I owe you a dozen,
okay? I'm sorry.

Take care of yourself.

[Henry] Yeah, you, too.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

288

- Thanks.

289

I, uh, bought that
almost 40 years ago...

290

a few years after
my family disappeared.

291

I never once had the courage
to even load it, much less...

292

I'm gonna make you
something to eat.

293

It was an ambush.

294

They knew we'd
go after the animals.

295

Goddamn things opened the pen

296

and just waited for us
to walk right to them.

297

How many did you save?

298

What's... What?

299

Animals.

300

How many did you save?
Was it worth it?

301

Risking everyone's lives,
for what?

302

An extra goat? A cow?

303

How much better off are we
today than we were yesterday?

304

Wait, wait.

305

Are you saying
that I had a choice?

306

- [scoffs]
- Those animals are all we have!

307

No, Boyd!
We are all we have!

308

Us! These people!
This family!

309

That is all we've got,
and now we've got one less!

310

So, what was...
what was I supposed to do?!

311

Just stand there,

312

watching our only resource go
wandering off into the woods?

313

We would have starved!

314

We would have found another way!

315

Yesterday you were ready
to crawl into a fucking hole

316

because the crops had spoiled!

317

And now you're standing there,
telling me

318

that we would have found
another way?!

319

That I shoulda just...
I shoulda...

320

That I should just...
get the fuck outta here!

321

- What the fuck am I...
- No, okay, No, you're right.

322

You're right.
You did what you had to do.

323

You did the only thing
you could do.

324

And you lost...

325

...because the game here
is fucking rigged.

326

And no matter what
hand you play, you lose.

327

Donna. Donna...

328

No, no, no.

329

I'm not angry at you, Boyd.

330

I'm not. [sighs]

331

I'm angry at me.

332

Angry at me

333

because you told us that,
someday, we'd go home...

334

[sighs] ...and I was stupid
enough to believe it.

335

- I'm...
- Get off!

336

342

- You know, I was thinking,

344

maybe we should go see Kristi,
uh, just as a precaution.

345

Ugh. [gasping]

346

Look, that's not necessary.

347

- It's just morning sickness.

Can you at least open the door?

349

I go see if Kristi

351

can just come up here,
and that way, you can just stay?

352

- Look, I said I'm fine!
- [water running]

353

I don't need everybody...

354

It doesn't feel right.

355

You're barely eating.

357

Fatima? Hey, look, come on.
What's going on?

358

Fatima, you're scaring me.
Come on.

360

Can you please open the door?

361

[door creaks]

362

Uh, I think you're right.
Maybe we should go see Kristi.

363

Kristi? You here?

364

Wait here.

365

Hello?

366

[Marielle] Coming.

367

- Hey.
- Is Kristi here?

368

Uh, she's...
She's down in town.

369

She's taking the news
about Tian-Chen pretty hard.

370

Listen, this can totally wait.

371

- The poor woman...
- No, it really can't.

372

Come on in.
I'll take a look at you.

373

You know what?
Maybe we should wait for Kristi.

374

Kristi's dealing
with a lot right now.

375

Yeah, but...

376

Look, no offense.
You're not a doctor.

377

I am, however,
a pediatric nurse.

378

So, as far as pregnancy goes,

379

I've pretty much seen
everything.

380

Come on. Come.

381

Kinda cold out for a swim.

382

What are you doing out here?

383

I just realized that...

384

I can't even remember
whose truck this was.

385

That's how many people we...

386

Danny.

387

And his, um...
his girlfriend Shay.

388

Right.

389

Danny and Shay.

390

They were good kids, yeah.

391

What happened last night, it...

392

wasn't your fault.

393

You know,
with all due respect, Kristi,

394

I'm... not here
for a pep talk.

395

All due respect, Boyd,
I don't really give a shit.

396

[sighs]

397

Look, after what happened
with Sara,

398

when she tried to hurt Ethan...

399

you sat with me in that diner

400

and you told me
it wasn't my fault,

401

that it was this place,

402

that I had saved a lot of lives,
and that I was gonna save

403

a hell of a lot more by the time
this all was finished.

404

So, was that just
a bunch of bullshit

405

to make me feel better,
or did you mean it?

406

[stammers]

407

Hey. This isn't your fault.
Okay?

408

Now, come on.
Let's go get you cleaned up.

415

462

Yeah. Okay.

463

When was the last time you ate?

464

Uh, three... four days?

465

She can't keep anything down.

466

I've tried to.

467

It's just even
the smell of food,

468

it's just...

469

- [exhales deeply]
- Deep breath.

470

Look, are you sure we
shouldn't just get Kristi?

471

- Ellis, just...
- How've you been doing

472

since, you know...

473

Since what?

474

Since I went through withdrawal,

475

or since this place...
mind-raped me?

476

Look, I know this is scary,

you're doing exactly what
you're supposed to be doing.

question you possibly can.

As for you,
you're severely malnourished.

It's a wonder

You also may have something
called hyperemesis gravidarum.

bad morning sickness.

"No matter how bad it gets,

have this day again."

592

Back before she disappeared,
my wife, Miranda,

593

started hearing voices.

594

She said they were children,
calling out to her,

595

that they were...

596

locked in a tower somewhere,

597

you know,
crying out to be saved.

598

She was terrified of them.

599

The only person
I ever repeated that to

600

was the investigating detective,

601

and he died 20 years ago.

602

When you're done,
I-I wanna show you something.

603

Yeah.

604

I want you to look at this room.

605

This is where my children slept.

606

My little boy.

607

My little girl.

608

They were the lights of my life.

609

And when they disappeared...

610

it ripped my life to pieces.

611

I didn't care
about the accusations.

612

I didn't care that everyone
thought that I did it.

613

But...

614

all I could think,
all I could... remember,

615

even now,

616

is that the last words
I said to them,

617

"Clean your room
or no TV."

618

And then, I went to work.

619

When I came home...
they were gone.

620

Why are you showing me this?

621

I don't know how you know

622

about those children
my wife heard.

623

I don't know how you got a hold
of my son's lunchbox or...

624

or how you could have possibly
faked those articles online.

625

[stammers]
The only possible explanation

626

I can come up with...

627

...is that you're
actually...

628

telling the truth,
and that means my son is alive.

629

And that...

630

That means something
I-I don't...

I don't even have
the words to... express.

632

So, if you,
if this isn't real...

you tell me right now.

some cruel, elaborate...

635

No, no, no, no, no.
