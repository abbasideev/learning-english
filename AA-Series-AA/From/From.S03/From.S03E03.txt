As good as can be expected.

Good. Yeah.

Okay.
If you don't tell her, I will.

I wanna catch
one of those things.

175
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,050
Sorry, what?

176
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,052
Those things show up
every night,

177
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:32,054
every goddamn night,

178
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,418
and we still have no idea
what we're dealing with,

where they come from.

180

Boyd, we have been down
this road.

181
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:42,824
You have already caught one.
No. I killed one.

182
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,230
That's different.
We need to learn about them.

183
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,830
We already know they talk,

184
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:51,473
so, we catch one.
We make it talk.

185
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:52,955
Oh, you're gonna make it talk.

186
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:55,319
How are you gonna do that?
You gonna torture it?

187
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,242
We have hit those things
point blank with shotguns,

188
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,444
and all it makes them do
is smile!

189
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,765
They are not human.

190
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,888
Well, according to Kristi,
they were at some point!

191
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,569
Oh, and what part of
that reassures you?

192
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,171
We gotta do something,
all right?
ELLIS: Dad.

193
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:12,416
We can't...
We gotta fucking do something.

194
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,063
How you gonna do it?
I am working on that.

195
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:22,346
Great. Work harder.

196

I miss Tian-Chen, too,
and believe me,

198
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,364
I do not want us
to not go out there,

to watch you get killed,

they're positioned.

the same way

it was a long time ago.

We have people back in town
who are hungry now.

227
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,761
So, all right, Jim and I pulled

228
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:01,003
and gathered as much
as we could before we left.

out there on the ground

This was always

there's something like this

like, opening, you know,
one that you can, like, step in

and it will just take you
somewhere.
