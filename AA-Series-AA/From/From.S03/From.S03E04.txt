Ah! Fuck! Just get
this fucking thing off of me.

3

[Kenny] Pull! Pull!

4

- Ah!
- Oh! Shit.

5

- Are you good?
- [stammers] My ankle.

6

- It's dislocated.
- All right.

7

- Let's get her back to camp.
- Okay.

8

[Boyd] <i>I wanna catch one
of those things.</i>

9

<i>We need to learn about them.</i>

10

We catch one.
We make it talk.

11

[buzzing]

12

[yelping]

13

- Hey.
- [panting]

14

Maybe we switch tonight.

15

- I'll take the bus.
- Why?

16

Because I wanna
watch our friends

17

when they come out
of the woods tonight.

18

We need to build a fort.

19

Then I'm gonna tell a story.

20

Are those the crops?

21

Yeah. We figured
we'd try composting them.

22

[Tillie]
<i>Whatever's going on,</i>

23

<i>I promise it'll pass.</i>

24

Is my baby okay?

25

Let's see what
the cards have to say.

26

- [people shouting]
- [bird cawing]

27

Miranda used to call it
the bottle tree.

28

The original's
in a park a few towns over.

29

Miranda made that for me.

30

This can't be real.

31

<i>I found this in the diner.</i>

32

Pull over right now!

33

- No!
- No, no!

34

We're going!

35

[engine roaring]

36

- [horns honking]
- Ah!

37

- [smashing]
- [Henry] Ah!

38

- [siren wailing]
- Where am I?

39

There's a tree in the middle
of the road.

Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5.

Hospital, do you copy?

42

Do you copy?

Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5.
Mechanical en route.

44

[static hissing on radio]

45

Copy. Copy.

46

Just getting static.

47

Where is everyone?

48

Should be at least a little
traffic this time of day.

49

Yeah, well, we're not
gonna move it, so...

50

- [sighing]
- [driver] My God.

51

Unit 4-5. Do you copy?

52

- Oh, my God.
- We're 30, 35 out.

53

We got a tree blocking the road.

54

Unit 4-5. Do you copy?

55

Miss, I need you to get
back in the vehicle.

56

No.

57

[crows cawing]

58

Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5. Do...

59

[cawing continuing]

60

[cawing louder]

61

[cawing continuing]

62

Just take a detour!
Go around it!

63

Ma'am, let's get back inside.

64

- It's not gonna work.
- It's okay.

65

- It's not gonna work.
- We'll take another way.

66

It's okay. It's okay.

67

[cawing continuing]

68

- It's all right.
- It's not gonna work!

69

It'll be okay.
We'll get you back inside.

70

- You have to listen to me!
- Come on.

Hello?

75

[boy] <i>Ethan? It's Thomas.</i>

76

<i>Mommy's in trouble.
She's in an ambulance.</i>

77

What ambulance?

78

<i>You'll see.
She's on her way,</i>

79

<i>but you have to help her.</i>

80

<i>You can't be afraid.</i>

81

[static crackling]

82

Who is this?

83

<i>I told you. It's Thomas.</i>

84

Who is this really?

85

What is this?

86

[static crackling]

87

Who are you talking to?

88

He says he's Thomas.

89

[static crackling]

90

[boy] <i>Hi, Jim.</i>

91

You leave my children alone.

96

[phone bell dings]

97

[Julie] Dad?

98

What did he say?

99

Ethan, I need you to talk to me.

100

What did he say?

101

That Mom was alive.

102

She's on an ambulance.
She needs our help.

[indistinct chattering
in background]

128

What are you waiting for?
Pick it up.

129

You pick it up. I'm not
touching that thing.

130

[Nicky] It's dead. What are
you worried about?

131

That bird just went kamikaze

132

through a plate-glass window
to get in here.

133

Whatever bad juju
that thing has,

134

I don't want any part of it.

135

And by the way,

136

I don't mean to ask
the obvious question here,

137

but do you think it's really
smart to do tarot readings

138

in a place like this?

139

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

140

Hey, that's enough.
We got plenty to worry about

141

without people
sniping at each other.

142

Hey, you all right?

143

I'm good.

144

You sure?

145

[pats]

146

I had no idea things
were so exciting up here.

147

Open.

148

You're good.

149

Look, this really is
not necessary.

150

Don't be silly.

151

I make it a point
to examine all my patients

152

after they've had encounters
with psychotic birds.

153

Besides, um, it's helping
take my mind off

154

of Kristi being
out at that lake.

155

No. They'll be fine.

156

They've got shelter.

157

They've got talismans.

158

- It's all you need.
- I know.

159

- [tap running]
- But if it was Ellis,

160

I would be feeling the same way.

161

Drink.

162

It's nice to just be

163

taking care of a pregnant
Mama bear again.

164

You look much better.

165

Your color's improved.

166

You've been eating
a little more?

167

Yeah. Finally found
something I could keep down.

168

Great. Get that baby
nice and strong.

169

Mm.

170

We used to play in here.

171

Not at night.

172

At nighttime,
everyone had to hide.

173

There were no talismans then.

174

But during the daytime,

175

my sister and I would
play inside the houses.

176

We pretended that
we were home again.

177

She always liked
this one the best,

178

and I never knew why.

179

You came here with your sister?

180

My mother, too, but they died.

181

Just like Nathan,

182

except I didn't murder them.

183

Is this enough?

184

Yeah, that's good.

185

[grunting]

186

I don't understand what
we're doing.

187

I told you, I have to remember.

188

Remember what?

189

When I was a boy, my mother
tried to save everyone,

190

but she died.
And then everyone died,

191

and I can't remember how or why.

192

And I think I need to
remember soon.

193

Why?

194

Too many things are changing.

195

It's never snowed here before.

196

We have to go in the basement.

197

Up here is for daytime stories.

198

The basement's for secrets.

199

Hello? Unit 4-5.

200

How are we still
in the goddamn woods?

201

We were right outside the city
when we stopped at that tree.

202

What does the GPS say?

203

Same thing it said ten minutes
ago... data unavailable.

204

We gotta be driving in circles.
The woods aren't this deep.

205

Okay, fine.
I'll turn around.

206

No, no, no!
Please don't turn around!

207

Uh, just... just
keep going forward.

208

- Whoa. Lady, calm down.
- If you turn around,

209

you'll be driving
away from town!

210

What town?
We're looking for the highway.

211

I know, I know, but, uh...

212

you have to listen to me.
It's, uh...

213

It's not safe to stop out here
once it gets dark,

214

but there's a town up ahead,

215

and... and people
there can help us.

216

You just... you just need
to keep going forward, please!

217

So, you're gonna
watch these things,

218

get a sense of how
they move and what they do,

219

and that's gonna what?

220

Give you some grand insight
into how you're gonna catch one?

221

Yeah. Something like that.

222

Yeah. Okay.

223

I'm sure nothing terrible
is gonna come of that.

224

Why are you here?

225

What do you mean?

226

I said we could switch.

227

You could be fast asleep by
now in the sheriff's station.

228

So, why are you here?

229

That's none of your business.

230

What the fuck
do you care, anyway?

231

'Cause if I gotta stand here
all night and listen to you,

232

I'd at least like
to know why that is.

233

Look, if you're
gonna do something

234

that has even
the slightest chance

235

of getting us
the hell out of here,

236

no matter how stupid
or ill-advised

237

that thing might be...

238

then I wanna help.

239

Oh. So, now, all of a sudden,
you're a team player.

240

If you'd seen
the things I've seen,

241

then you might be, too.

242

What are you talking about,
seen the things you've seen?

243

What do you think
I'm talking about, Boyd?

244

Me, Julie, Marielle,

245

wherever we were.

246

Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

247

Well, I don't think
that's the worst thing

248

that can happen to you here.

249

I want out.

250

[fire crackling]

251

[pencil scribbling]

252

[groaning softly]

253

You should get some sleep.

254

Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

255

Sorry.
Did I wake you up?

256

No. The, uh, throbbing pain
in my ankle did.

257

Is there anything I can
do to help make it better?

258

[groaning]

259

No, not until, uh, some
of the swelling goes down.

260

What are you writing?

261

It's just, uh,
something for my mom.

262

In Chinese culture,
we write letters to the dead

263

on high holidays.

264

It's not really a holiday,
I guess, but...

265

I think she'd really like that.

266

Yep.

267

I meant what I said earlier.

268

You're not alone here.

269

Things are different now.
That's all.

270

Yeah.

271

It just feels like
all of a sudden...

272

...everything that I thought
I was fighting for is gone.

273

And everything that I thought
I was going home to.

274

And the two people that
I would talk to about that

275

are you and Mom.

276

You can still talk to me.

277

[Jade] Could you maybe
talk in the morning?

278

Sorry.

279

[sighs] Fuck it.

280

[grunts] I'm awake.

281

Hey.

282

[groaning]

283

You guys wanna hear
something crazy?

284

The night everyone died,

285

I was in the root cellar.

286

My mother told Eloise and I
to hide there.

287

Eloise didn't listen.

288

But I did.

289

I stayed until morning.

290

And when I came out,

291

there were bodies everywhere.

292

That was the day that
I met the boy in white.

293

You know the boy in white?

294

He's my friend.

295

He was my only friend all
those years that I was alone.

296

[creaking]

297

Couldn't bury them all.

298

They were just lying there
in the street,

299

and I... I couldn't bury them.

300

So the boy in white told me

301

to gather things that were
precious to them.

302

To bury those instead.

303

This stuff...

304

that'll help you remember
why it happened?

305

I think so.

306

Why are we in here?

307

Because it's a fort.

308

Why do you need me?

309

Because I don't want
to do this alone.

310

I may have to remember
some scary things.

311

And you're the scariest
person here,

312

so it won't scare <i>you.</i>

313

You always this fidgety?

314

Something's wrong.

315

Those things should be
all over the place by now.

316

Really?

317

These things give
"creature of habit"

318

a whole new goddamn meaning.

319

The one in the nurse's uniform?

320

I'm her first stop every night,

321

every single night.

322

She just stands by the glass,
and she hums.

323

For about ten minutes,
she just stands,

324

taps on the glass
with her fucking smile.

325

And there's another one, right?

326

Likes to sit over there
by the swing.

327

- Okay.
- Just letting its legs dangle.

328

There's another couple like
to sit over there

329

by the pool, just...

330

Well, you really
watch these things closely.

331

Yeah, well, there's no TV.

332

Plus, you guys get to
draw the shades at night.

333

I got...

334

Look. The point is,
they got patterns, routines,

335

all of which should be
happening right now.

336

Right now.

337

Ma'am, you're
not making any sense.

338

I know this road!
There's a town up ahead.

339

The people there can help us
find the highway again.

340

- Okay.
- I promise you.

341

We just need to keep
going that way.

342

We're... we're here!
The barn is here!

343

- We're... Stop! Stop here!
- Lady, we're fine, okay?

344

We're not gonna stop
in the middle of nowhere.

345

Fuck.

346

[vehicle approaching]

347

Oh, shit. What the...

348

What the fuck?

349

It's an ambulance,
just like he said!

350

Hey!

351

Hey!

352

Mom!

353

Oh, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

354

- [Jim] Get in here!
- I got him.

355

- [Jim] Hey!
- [Ethan] No!

356

- [Boyd] Got him.
- No!

357

- Let's get back inside.
- No! Mom!

358

You need to stop.
Please stop.

359

Look, lady. I'm not gonna
tell you again, okay?

360

Shit.

361

- What's wrong?
- We got a body in the road.

362

What if Mom's really out there?

363

{\an8}- What's he talking about?
- Uh...

364

The voice on the phone said
she'd be on an ambulance.

365

There's somebody lying
in the middle of the road.

366

No. It's not
a fucking person!

367

- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus! Hey!

368

- That is not a fucking person!
- Okay!

369

We're just gonna calm down, okay?

370

- No, no, no!
- Go ahead. I got this.

371

You are not fucking
listening to me.

372

Where are you going?
Don't go.

373

- Please don't fucking go!
- Ma'am!

374

- [officer] Move!
- Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am.

375

- You're gonna fucking die!
- Okay. You need to calm down!

376

You need to fucking calm down!
They're gonna die!

377

They're gonna fucking die!

378

- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

379

Ma'am, can you hear me?

380

- Okay.
- Here. Help me roll her over.

381

Come on.

382

Watch her head.

383

I'm not getting a pulse.

384

Hey, guys!

385

Lady's really freaking out
back here.

386

What the...

387

- [screeching]
- Aah!

388

[screeching]

389

[grunting]

390

[choking]

391

Oh, my God!

392

Aah!

393

[groaning]

394

[screeching]

395

Back up!

396

[firing shot]

397

[gun firing twice]

398

- Okay.
- [Julie] Those were gunshots!

399

Which means those things are
already out there.

400

[panting]

401

[panting]

402

Oh, my God. Henry?

403

- [groaning] What?
- It's okay.

404

- What?
- We're okay.

405

If there's even a chance
my wife is out there...

406

You do what you want.

407

Okay. Listen.
You gotta stay inside.

408

Whoever's on that ambulance,
you'll be putting them

409

in danger if we have to worry
about you, okay?

410

I need you to
tell me you understand.

411

- I understand.
- Julie?

412

Yeah.

413

We are in real danger right now.

414

There are things in this town
that will hurt us

415

if we don't get inside
one of the houses.

416

- [creature screeching]
- [gasping]

417

- Ah!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

418

Oh, mother of God!

419

- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

420

Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

421

Tabitha.

422

Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

423

Help me! Help me!

424

Please help me, baby!

425

- Please help us!
- Are there keys?

426

I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know where they are!

427

Everybody, out of
the ambulance, now!

428

Ah!

429

- Jesus.
- What the fuck?

430

- Handcuffs.
- What?

431

You have handcuffs.
Hand me the keys.

432

I... I... I don't
have them. I... No...

433

There's a toolkit
on the bus. I got it.

434

- No! Wait, wait!
- Got it!

435

All right!
Stay, stay, stay!

436

- [clanging]
- Runner on the hill!

437

Runner on the hill!

438

- [clanging continuing]
- [people talking excitedly]

439

[panting]

440

- [firing gun]
- [screeching]

441

- [firing gun]
- I think it's a cop.

442

443

[firing gun]

444

[creature screeching]

445

- [firing gun]
- [glass shattering]

446

- Ah!
- [people screaming]

447

- [woman] What was that?
- Nicky's been shot!

448

[Marielle] Excuse me.
Excuse me.

449

- [Nicky groans]
- [Ellis] What happened?

450

- Did she hit her head?
- I don't know.

451

Get that window boarded up.

452

Um, here,
get her onto the couch.

453

- [people shouting]
- [man] Let her have some air.

454

- [Marielle] Come on.
- All right. All right.

455

[people chattering]

456

- [man] Did you see?
- It's Nicky?

457

Hey, Nicky. I'm Marielle.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

458

- [man] Easy, easy.
- [Nicky groaning]

459

Help me roll her onto her side.
Okay. All right.

460

[Nicky shouting in pain]

461

Okay. No exit wound.
We need to get this bullet out.

462

- [rattling, knocking]
- Hey, open up!

463

- I'm a police officer!
- Hey, move.

464

- What are you doing?
- [cop] Please! Open the door!

465

She's a cop. We can't just
leave her out there.

466

We should wait for Kristi.

467

Kristi's not back until
tomorrow.

468

We need to do this now. Hey, I'm
gonna need a lot of things...

469

uh, tweezers, pliers,
uh, alcohol, and towels.

470

Okay. Yeah, yeah.

[Nicky shouting in pain]

473

474

- Oh, my God.

476

[Nicky shouting in pain]

477

- Okay.
- [Nicky shouting in pain]

478

Oh, God. Those things were
coming from everywhere.

479

- Back off!
- I didn't mean to... No. Listen.

480

You gotta believe me.
Please, you gotta believe me.

481

- It must have been a misfire!
- I said back the fuck up!

482

Oh, God. This isn't real.

483

This isn't real. This...
this can't be happening.

484

This isn't real.

485

- Is there anyone with you?
- What?

486

- Is there anyone else out there?
- Is she gonna be okay?

487

How did you get here?

488

We were in an ambulance.

489

There was this... this...
this tree.

490

[insects buzzing]

491

Where are the...
can't find the fucking keys.

492

Get the fuck back.

493

I said get the fuck back!

494

Oh, sweetie,
it doesn't work that way.

495

[grunting]

496

Hey, get back to the bus!

497

[insects buzzing]

[yelping]

499

- Hey, Jim!
- Hey. Tools.

500

501

[Tabitha] Get something!
Get something!

502

[Henry groaning]

505

Motherfucker! [panting]

506

507

We get to keep Randall, though.

508

- [buzzing]
- [choking, coughing]

509

Get off me! [grunts]

510

- [Randall grunting]
- You can't save them all.

511

Ah! [grunting]

512

[panting]

513

[Jim] Boyd, let's go!
We gotta get out of here!

514

Fuck you! Fuck you!

515

- Motherfuckers.
- Fuck you!

516

[engine starts]

517

Boyd? Boyd, don't you leave me,
you piece of shit!

518

[creature screeching]

519

Apply pressure right here.

520

- [moaning]
- Okay. All right. Good.

521

- Good. Okay. Good.
- Yeah?

522

Hey, hey. Are you
sure you've got this?

523

Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

524

Sit here.

525

Hold her legs down.

526

Okay. Okay. I got it.

527

528

Shit. Okay. Let me see.

Bite down. Bite down.

537

- [Fatima] You got this.

538

- [Marielle] All right.
- [Fatima] It's okay. It's okay.

539

[Nicky shouting]

540

Okay. I think I got it.

541

[Nicky shouting]

542

Okay.

543

[Nicky shouting]

544

Okay. I got it.

545

[Nicky shouting]

546

Yeah.

547

Good job.

548

There's a woman
in the ambulance.

549

There were two paramedics
outside, and I don't know

550

where she is, but this is
probably 20 minutes...

551

It's okay.

552

- Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes!
- That's it. That's it.

553

- Yes! Thank you!
- All right. Can you get up?

554

- Yes.
- Yeah?

555

Henry, let's go.
Let's go, Henry.

556

- And you? Can you walk?
- I think so.

557

[Henry moaning]

558

Come on. Come on.
I got you. I got you.

559

[moaning]

560

You okay?

561

[shuts off engine]

562

- [Boyd] I got him!
- Oh, my God! Hurry!

563

I got him. I got him. I got him.
I got him. Come here.

564

- Come here.
- [creature screeching]

565

I got you. I got you.

566

Let's go.

567

[people murmuring quietly]

568

[Boyd] There you go.
Come on.

569

[people murmuring excitedly]

570

- Oh.
- [Boyd] There you go.

571

- There you go. Close that door.
- [Henry moaning]

572

[door closes, metal clattering]

573

[people murmuring]

574

You okay?

575

Look.

576

[people murmuring]

577

- [man] Bad idea.
- [people murmuring]

578

Hey, what happened?

579

Uh, it was a long night.

580

For everyone, it seems.

581

[people murmuring]

582

I fucking told you.

583

Donna, can we, uh...

584

Uh, you can. Uh, I'll put you
in a room upstairs.

585

Are you okay?

586

Yeah. Come on.

587

[people murmuring]

588

That poor girl.

589

Nicky's gonna be all right.

590

No. I'm not talking
about Nicky.

591

I'm talking about Fatima.

592

That horrible bird.

593

What if it was a sign?

594

What's wrong?

595

Am I awake?

596

Where are you going?

597

Help me.

598

- Please!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599

[chattering in distance]

600

Can you see anything?

601

No.

602

What if they don't come back?

603

Don't think like that.

604

They'll come back.

605

Julie, what happened to you?

606

What do you mean?

607

Ever since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

608

you've been different.

609

Are you sure you're okay?

610

Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

611

I don't believe you.

612

You know I'm not a baby anymore.

613

You can tell me things.

614

You wanna know the truth?

615

I'm really scared.

616

I saw things that I
don't really understand.

617

There's things that
I can't even remember.

618

All I remember
is being more scared

619

than I've ever been
in my entire life.

620

And that's the truth.

621

I haven't told anybody but you.

622

I'm trying really hard
to be okay.

623

Can I help?

624

[chuckles] Hey,
I'm the big sister here.

625

I'm the one who
takes care of you.

626

If they don't come back,
it'll just be us.

627

We have to start taking care
of each other from now on.

628

They'll come back.

629

So, the rod was through his eye?

630

Mm. Well, only when
he was on the tree.

631

When he walked up to me
with a skull full of blood,

632

it was just a...
a bloody, empty socket.

633

- Jesus.
- [Jade sighing]

634

Yeah. So, that's what
my life's been like lately.

635

How long has this been
going on for?

636

The hallucinating?

637

Pretty much since I got here.

638

Do you remember that day I took
you down to the root cellar,

639

told you I saw that
symbol up on the ceiling?

640

You thought I was crazy?

641

[sighing]

642

Tian-Chen saw me in the diner.

643

I was drawing the symbol over
and over again, losing my mind,

644

and first, she made me tea.

645

And then she took me back
into the storage room,

646

and she, uh...

647

she pulled out this.

648

Still have no idea
how she knew it was there.

649

My mom knew every inch
of that storage room.

650

[chuckling]

651

You know, I thought
I was smart enough

652

to figure this place out, and...

653

I should have...

654

Fuck.

655

She really liked you,
you know? My mom.

656

I think she tolerated me
more than anything.

657

[Kenny] No, no, no.
I mean, she really, uh...

658

She only frowned
at people that she liked.

659

I mean, the people that
she didn't, she just... ignored.

660

[chuckles]

661

[Kristi grunting] Ow.

662

When you finish that letter,

663

tell her we all say hi.

664

[thudding]

665

- Jesus.
- [whispering] Shh.

666

It's okay. It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

667

[creaking]

668

Are you sure those things
you saw today

669

were hallucinations?

670

Uh, this belonged
to Mr. Gerber.

671

He always smelled like onions.

672

They grow wild in the woods,

673

so he would pick them
and eat them raw.

674

[sniffs]

675

- [rattling]
- Hmm.

676

Oh. This was from Delores.

677

She always cried lots.

678

Mm.

679

Mm.

680

- [grunting]
- What's wrong?

681

Nothing for Christopher.

682

Who was Christopher?

683

He was our friend.

684

He... he was nice,

685

but then he started
seeing the symbol,

686

and then he started
getting scary.

687

What?

688

[grunting]

689

No. This was a mistake. I don't
want to do this anymore.

690

- Victor.
- No! I said no!

691

- Victor!
- I said no!

692

- Victor!
- No, no, no, no!

693

- Victor!
- No, no!

694

- Victor! Victor!
- No, no!

695

- Hey, hey.
- [moaning]

696

Shh. It's okay.

697

You don't have to be afraid.

698

I'm the scariest person
in town, remember?

699

I know what's missing.

700

[Christopher in high voice]
Hello, Victor!

701

His name was Jasper.

702

I, uh...

703

I left him.

704

I just...

705

I just fucking left.

706

Oh, my God, Boyd.

707

You know, I couldn't... I...
I tried to save everybody.

708

Like, what the fuck
was Tabitha doing

709

in the back of that
goddamn ambulance? I...

710

How did she...

711

Are you sure he...
he's really Victor's father?

712

Jim, I stood in the house
that Victor grew up in.

713

Jesus.

714

His mother, Miranda,

715

she saw this place
before she even got here.

716

She had these paintings and...

717

[sighs]

718

I think that was the reason
why I was sent there.

719

The little boy in the tower...

720

I think he wanted me
to see something,

721

find something.
[sniffling]

722

And I tried. [crying]

723

I just...

724

I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

725

Oh, hey, hey, hey. You have
nothing to be sorry about.

726

You are back, and you are safe.

727

And that is all that matters.

728

Okay?

729

But what if that was
our only chance to go home?

730

[Nicky shouting in pain]

731

- Hey.
- [man] Is she all right?

732

- Oh, shit. Nicky?
- [coughing]

733

What's wrong with her?

734

No.

735

[Fatima]
Oh, my God. What is...

736

She's bleeding internally.

737

The bullet must have done
more damage than I...

738

- Oh, God.
- Nicky, Nicky,

739

Nicky, stay with me, okay?

740

You're okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

741

- Nicky?
- [woman] Come on, Nicky.

742

Shit.

743

Come on.

744

Nicky, stay with me! Nicky?

745

- [man] No.
- [woman] Oh, no.

746

Come on. [grunting]

747

Shit. Come on.

Come on. Come on.

[woman] Nicky?

751

Oh, no.

752

You see what you've done?

753

It was an accident.

754

What's wrong with you,
Officer? Huh?

755

Something scares you,
you just start shooting, huh?

756

- Is that right?
- I'm sorry.

757

You're sorry?
You're sorry, eh?

758

Come tell Nicky you're sorry!

759

- Come on now.
- Get the fuck off me!

760

- Hey!
- Listen!

761

You come with me
right fucking now!

762

God! God!

763

Shut the door.

764

Look. I'm not really in the
mood for a lecture right now,

765

so if all we're gonna do...

766

Hey, Donna?

767

[sobbing]
Why is this happening?

768

Why is it just one thing
after another after another?

769

Why can't they stop?

770

Why can't they leave us alone?

771

Um, I don't know.
I don't know.

772

Oh, Boyd,
I am so fucking scared.

773

Oh, oh, I'm so fucking scared.

774

All right.

775

Jasper belonged to Christopher.

776

He used to be so much fun.

777

Christopher would
make us all laugh.

778

And people didn't
laugh much back then,

779

so it was very nice
that we could.

780

But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

781

and he changed.

782

He didn't make us laugh anymore.

783

I remember Christopher started

784

spending more
and more time alone.

785

And one day...
