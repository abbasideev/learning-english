1
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,246
Previously on from.

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,496
Fuck! Just get this
fucking thing off of me.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,497
Pull! Pull!

4
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,326
Shit.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,496
- Are you good?
- My ankle.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,546
- It's dislocated.
- All right.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,416
- Let's get her back to camp.
- Okay.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,166
I wanna catch one of those things.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,336
<i>We need to learn about them.</i>

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,240
We catch one. We make it talk.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,396
Hey.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,226
Maybe we switch tonight.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,356
- I'll take the bus.
- Why?

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,566
Because I wanna watch our friends

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,380
when they come out
of the woods tonight.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,406
We need to build a fort.

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,406
Then I'm gonna tell a story.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,236
Are those the crops?

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,270
Yeah. We figured we'd
try composting them.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,246
<i>Whatever's going on, I promise it'll pass.</i>

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,586
Is my baby okay?

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,570
Let's see what the cards have to say.

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,546
Miranda used to call it the bottle tree.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,266
The original's in a park a few towns over.

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,386
Miranda made that for me.

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,476
This can't be real.

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,266
<i>I found this in the diner.</i>

28
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,396
Pull over right now!

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,566
- No!
- No, no!

30
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,630
We're going!

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,486
Where am I?

32
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,150
There's a tree in the middle of the road.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,376
Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,256
Hospital, do you copy?

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,626
Do you copy?

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,410
Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5. Mechanical en route.

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,306
Copy. Copy.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,500
Just getting static.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,436
Where is everyone?

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,516
Should be at least a
little traffic this time of day.

41
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,316
Yeah, well, we're not gonna move it, so...

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,460
My god.

43
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,526
Unit 4-5. Do you copy?

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,446
- My god.
- We're 30, 35 out.

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,616
We got a tree blocking the road.

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,600
Unit 4-5. Do you copy?

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,520
Miss, I need you to
get back in the vehicle.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,440
No.

49
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,690
Unit 4-5. Unit 4-5. Do...

50
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,486
Just take a detour! Go around it!

51
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,696
Ma'am, let's get back inside.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,496
- It's not gonna work.
- It's okay.

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,366
- It's not gonna work.
- We'll take another way.

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,390
It's okay. It's okay.

55
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,786
- It's all right.
- It's not gonna work!

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,456
It'll be okay. We'll get you back inside.

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,400
- You have to listen to me!
- Come on.

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,737
Hello?

59
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,566
Ethan? It's Thomas.

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,696
<i>Mommy's in trouble.
She's in an ambulance.</i>

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,536
What ambulance?

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,536
<i>You'll see. She's on her way,</i>

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,576
<i>but you have to help her.</i>

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>You can't be afraid.</i>

65
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,706
Who is this?

66
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,546
<i>I told you. It's Thomas.</i>

67
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,716
Who is this really?

68
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,700
What is this?

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,386
Who are you talking to?

70
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,410
He says he's Thomas.

71
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,590
Hi, Jim.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,776
You leave my children alone.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
<i>But they're not your children anymore.</i>

74
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,530
Dad?

75
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,670
What did he say?

76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,817
Ethan, I need you to talk to me.

77
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,606
What did he say?

78
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,566
That mom was alive.

79
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,680
She's on an ambulance.
She needs our help.

80
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,906
What are you waiting for? Pick it up.

81
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,906
You pick it up. I'm
not touching that thing.

82
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,666
It's dead. What are you worried about?

83
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,876
That bird just went kamikaze

84
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,916
through a plate-glass
window to get in here.

85
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,666
Whatever bad juju that thing has,

86
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,626
I don't want any part of it.

87
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,836
And by the way,

88
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,586
I don't mean to ask the
obvious question here,

89
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,596
but do you think it's really
smart to do tarot readings

90
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,716
in a place like this?

91
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,056
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

92
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,636
hey, that's enough. We
got plenty to worry about

93
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,670
without people sniping at each other.

94
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,880
Hey, you all right?

95
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,776
I'm good.

96
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,720
You sure?

97
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,996
I had no idea things
were so exciting up here.

98
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,810
Open.

99
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,966
You're good.

100
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,796
Look, this really is not necessary.

101
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,846
Don't be silly.

102
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,846
I make it a point to
examine all my patients

103
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,636
after they've had encounters
with psychotic birds.

104
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,976
Besides, it's helping take my mind off

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,846
of kristi being out at that lake.

106
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,896
No. They'll be fine.

107
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,976
They've got shelter.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,816
They've got talismans.

109
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,720
- It's all you need.
- I know.

110
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,906
But if it was Ellis,

111
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,940
I would be feeling the same way.

112
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Drink.

113
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,006
It's nice to just be

114
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,900
taking care of a pregnant
mama bear again.

115
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,716
You look much better.

116
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,846
Your color's improved.

117
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,990
You've been eating a little more?

118
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,976
Yeah. Finally found
something I could keep down.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
Great. Get that baby nice and strong.

120
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,776
We used to play in here.

121
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,946
Not at night.

122
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,076
At nighttime, everyone had to hide.

123
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,986
There were no talismans then.

124
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,076
But during the daytime,

125
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,020
my sister and I would
play inside the houses.

126
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,046
We pretended that we were home again.

127
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,796
She always liked this one the best,

128
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,716
and I never knew why.

129
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,046
You came here with your sister?

130
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,806
My mother, too, but they died.

131
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,000
Just like Nathan, except
I didn't murder them.

132
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,050
Is this enough?

133
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,010
Yeah, that's good.

134
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,786
I don't understand what we're doing.

135
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,076
I told you, I have to remember.

136
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,150
Remember what?

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,126
When I was a boy, my
mother tried to save everyone,

138
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,006
but she died. And then everyone died,

139
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,926
and I can't remember how or why.

140
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,950
And I think I need to remember soon.

141
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,096
Why?

142
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,016
Too many things are changing.

143
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,000
It's never snowed here before.

144
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,896
We have to go in the basement.

145
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,856
Up here is for daytime stories.

146
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,840
The basement's for secrets.

147
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,850
Hello? Unit 4-5.

148
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,996
How are we still in the goddamn woods?

149
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,086
We were right outside the city
when we stopped at that tree.

150
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,966
What does the GPS say?

151
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,046
Same thing it said ten
minutes ago... data unavailable.

152
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,046
We gotta be driving in circles.
The woods aren't this deep.

153
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,966
Okay, fine. I'll turn around.

154
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,967
No, no, no! Please don't turn around!

155
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:07,806
Just... just keep going forward.

156
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,976
- Whoa. Lady, calm down.
- If you turn around,

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,056
you'll be driving away from town!

158
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,816
What town? We're
looking for the highway.

159
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,936
I know, I know, but...

160
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,236
You have to listen to me. It's

161
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,196
it's not safe to stop out
here once it gets dark,

162
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,946
but there's a town up ahead,

163
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,406
and... and people there can help us.

164
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,670
You just... you just need to
keep going forward, please!

165
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,836
So, you're gonna watch these things,

166
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,216
get a sense of how they
move and what they do,

167
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,846
and that's gonna what?

168
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,886
Give you some grand insight
into how you're gonna catch one?

169
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,920
Yeah. Something like that.

170
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,936
Yeah. Okay.

171
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sure nothing terrible
is gonna come of that.

172
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,106
Why are you here?

173
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,026
What do you mean?

174
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,196
I said we could switch.

175
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,866
You could be fast asleep
by now in the sheriff's station.

176
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,916
So, why are you here?

177
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,980
That's none of your business.

178
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,046
What the fuck do you care, anyway?

179
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,216
'Cause if I gotta stand here
all night and listen to you,

180
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,056
I'd at least like to know why that is.

181
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,016
Look, if you're gonna do something

182
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,226
that has even the slightest chance

183
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,976
of getting us the hell out of here,

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,056
no matter how stupid or ill-advised

185
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,936
that thing might be... Then I wanna help.

186
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,946
So, now, all of a sudden,
you're a team player.

187
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,236
If you'd seen the things I've seen,

188
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,116
then you might be, too.

189
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,076
What are you talking about,
seen the things you've seen?

190
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,230
What do you think I'm
talking about, Boyd?

191
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,190
Me, Julie, marielle, wherever we were.

192
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,296
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

193
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,926
Well, I don't think that's the worst thing

194
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,330
that can happen to you here.

195
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,040
I want out.

196
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,197
You should get some sleep.

197
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:30,156
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

198
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,366
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

199
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,310
No. The, throbbing pain in my ankle did.

200
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,150
Is there anything I can
do to help make it better?

201
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,070
No, not until, some of
the swelling goes down.

202
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,200
What are you writing?

203
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,976
It's just, something for my mom.

204
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,316
In Chinese culture, we
write letters to the dead

205
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,066
on high holidays.

206
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,026
It's not really a holiday, I guess, but

207
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,156
I think she'd really like that.

208
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,366
Yep.

209
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,156
I meant what I said earlier.

210
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,326
You're not alone here.

211
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,366
Things are different now. That's all.

212
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,076
Yeah.

213
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,070
It just feels like all of a sudden

214
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,400
everything that I thought
I was fighting for is gone.

215
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,120
And everything that I
thought I was going home to.

216
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,056
And the two people that
I would talk to about that

217
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,316
are you and mom.

218
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,186
You can still talk to me.

219
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,130
Could you maybe talk in the morning?

220
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,430
Sorry.

221
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,116
Fuck it.

222
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,230
I'm awake.

223
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,450
Hey.

224
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,450
You guys wanna hear something crazy?

225
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,436
The night everyone died,
I was in the root cellar.

226
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,316
My mother told Eloise and I to hide there.

227
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,130
Eloise didn't listen.

228
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,470
But I did.

229
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,150
I stayed until morning.

230
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,136
And when I came out,

231
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,330
there were bodies everywhere.

232
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,250
That was the day that
I met the boy in white.

233
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,106
You know the boy in white?

234
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,606
He's my friend.

235
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,220
He was my only friend all
those years that I was alone.

236
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,506
Couldn't Bury them all.

237
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,416
They were just lying there in the street,

238
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,360
and I... I couldn't Bury them.

239
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,516
So the boy in white told me

240
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,380
to gather things that
were precious to them.

241
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,550
To Bury those instead.

242
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,196
This stuff

243
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,270
that'll help you remember
why it happened?

244
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,310
I think so.

245
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,520
Why are we in here?

246
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,230
Because it's a fort.

247
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,506
Why do you need me?

248
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,320
Because I don't want to do this alone.

249
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,370
I may have to remember
some scary things.

250
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,396
And you're the scariest person here,

251
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,290
so it won't scare you.

252
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,356
You always this fidgety?

253
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,366
Something's wrong.

254
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,366
Those things should be
all over the place by now.

255
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,536
Really?

256
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,286
These things give "creature of habit"

257
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,456
a whole new goddamn meaning.

258
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,536
The one in the nurse's uniform?

259
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,246
I'm her first stop every night,

260
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,416
every single night.

261
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,506
She just stands by the
glass, and she hums.

262
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,466
For about ten minutes, she just stands,

263
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,256
taps on the glass with her fucking smile.

264
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,506
And there's another one, right?

265
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,386
Likes to sit over there by the swing.

266
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,346
- Okay.
- Just letting its legs dangle.

267
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,556
There's another couple
like to sit over there

268
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,396
by the pool, just

269
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,436
well, you really watch
these things closely.

270
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,606
Yeah, well, there's no TV.

271
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,606
Plus, you guys get to
draw the shades at night.

272
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,566
I got...

273
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,486
Look. The point is, they
got patterns, routines,

274
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,640
all of which should be
happening right now.

275
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,536
Right now.

276
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,576
Ma'am, you're not making any sense.

277
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,416
I know this road!
There's a town up ahead.

278
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,496
The people there can help
us find the highway again.

279
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,246
- Okay.
- I promise you.

280
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,710
We just need to keep going that way.

281
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,306
We're... we're here! The barn is here!

282
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,596
- We're... stop! Stop here!
- Lady, we're fine, okay?

283
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,346
We're not gonna stop
in the middle of nowhere.

284
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,370
Fuck.

285
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,460
Shit. What the... What the fuck?

286
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,590
It's an ambulance, just like he said!

287
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,340
Hey!

288
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Hey!

289
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,656
Mom!

290
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,496
No, no. Hey, hey, hey!

291
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,496
- Get in here!
- I got him.

292
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,497
- Hey!
- No!

293
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,536
- Got him.
- No!

294
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,546
- Let's get back inside.
- No! Mom!

295
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,296
You need to stop. Please stop.

296
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,506
Look, lady. I'm not gonna
tell you again, okay?

297
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,440
Shit.

298
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,426
- What's wrong?
- We got a body in the road.

299
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,556
What if mom's really out there?

300
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,426
{\an8}What's he talking about?

301
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,580
The voice on the phone said
she'd be on an ambulance.

302
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,306
There's somebody lying
in the middle of the road.

303
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,396
No. It's not a fucking person!

304
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,476
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus! Hey!

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,566
- That is not a fucking person!
- Okay!

306
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,606
We're just gonna calm down, okay?

307
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,316
- No, no, no!
- Go ahead. I got this.

308
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,526
You are not fucking listening to me.

309
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,446
Where are you going? Don't go.

310
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,366
- Please don't fucking go!
- Ma'am!

311
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,866
- Move!
- Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am.

312
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,536
- You're gonna fucking die!
- Okay. You need to calm down!

313
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,666
You need to fucking calm
down! They're gonna die!

314
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,400
They're gonna fucking die!

315
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,466
- Jesus.
- My god.

316
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,546
Ma'am, can you hear me?

317
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,716
- Okay.
- Here. Help me roll her over.

318
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,506
Come on.

319
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,540
Watch her head.

320
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,596
I'm not getting a pulse.

321
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,516
Hey, guys!

322
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,566
Lady's really freaking out back here.

323
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,380
What the...

324
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,680
My god!

325
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,690
Back up!

326
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,676
- Okay.
- Those were gunshots!

327
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,580
Which means those
things are already out there.

328
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,536
My god. Henry?

329
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,456
- What?
- It's okay.

330
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,746
- What?
- We're okay.

331
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,496
If there's even a chance
my wife is out there...

332
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
You do what you want.

333
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,796
Okay. Listen. You gotta stay inside.

334
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,756
Whoever's on that ambulance,
you'll be putting them

335
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,426
in danger if we have to
worry about you, okay?

336
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,716
I need you to tell me you understand.

337
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,756
- I understand.
- Julie?

338
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,790
Yeah.

339
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,596
We are in real danger right now.

340
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,556
There are things in
this town that will hurt us

341
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,460
if we don't get inside one of the houses.

342
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,646
My god. My god!

343
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,646
Mother of god!

344
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,840
My god!

345
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,696
My god! Jim! Jim!

346
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,576
Tabitha.

347
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,560
My god! Jim! Jim!

348
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,666
Help me! Help me!

349
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,536
Please help me, baby!

350
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,786
- Please help us!
- Are there keys?

351
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,626
I don't know! I don't know! I
don't know where they are!

352
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,530
Everybody, out of the ambulance, now!

353
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,676
- Jesus.
- What the fuck?

354
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,636
- Handcuffs.
- What?

355
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,516
You have handcuffs. Hand me the keys.

356
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,726
I... I... I don't have them. I... no

357
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,646
there's a toolkit on the bus. I got it.

358
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,710
- No! Wait, wait!
- Got it!

359
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,736
All right! Stay, stay, stay!

360
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,920
Runner on the hill!

361
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,536
I think it's a cop.

362
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,690
What the fuck?

363
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,636
- What was that?
- Nicky's been shot!

364
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,846
Excuse me. Excuse me.

365
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,846
What happened?

366
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,646
- Did she hit her head?
- I don't know.

367
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,686
Get that window boarded up.

368
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,016
Here, get her onto the couch.

369
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,566
Let her have some air.

370
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,720
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

371
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,946
- Did you see?
- It's Nicky?

372
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,786
Hey, Nicky. I'm marielle.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

373
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,706
Easy, easy.

374
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,890
Help me roll her onto
her side. Okay. All right.

375
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,940
Okay. No exit wound. We
need to get this bullet out.

376
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,586
Hey, open up!

377
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,966
- I'm a police officer!
- Hey, move.

378
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,256
- What are you doing?
- Please! Open the door!

379
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,886
She's a cop. We can't
just leave her out there.

380
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,676
We should wait for kristi.

381
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,226
Kristi's not back until tomorrow.

382
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,936
We need to do this now. Hey,
I'm gonna need a lot of things

383
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,896
tweezers, pliers, alcohol, and towels.

384
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,870
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

385
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,686
I know.

386
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,590
Okay.

387
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,760
- Yes.
- My god.

388
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,576
Okay.

389
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,706
God. Those things were
coming from everywhere.

390
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,626
- Back off!
- I didn't mean to... no. Listen.

391
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,626
You gotta believe me.
Please, you gotta believe me.

392
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,956
- It must have been a misfire!
- I said back the fuck up!

393
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,876
God. This isn't real.

394
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,796
This isn't real. This...
this can't be happening.

395
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,926
This isn't real.

396
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,926
- Is there anyone with you?
- What?

397
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,766
- Is there anyone else out there?
- Is she gonna be okay?

398
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,677
How did you get here?

399
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,766
We were in an ambulance.

400
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,230
There was this... this... this tree.

401
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,010
Where are the... can't
find the fucking keys.

402
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,656
Get the fuck back.

403
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,706
I said get the fuck back!

404
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,810
Sweetie, it doesn't work that way.

405
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
Hey, get back to the bus!

406
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,976
- Hey, Jim!
- Hey. Tools.

407
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,976
- Boyd, we got to go.
- Yeah.

408
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,920
Get something! Get something!

409
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,816
I can't find the fucking keys!

410
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,816
- Where the...
- are you looking for these?

411
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,696
Motherfucker!

412
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,996
Take them.

413
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,890
We get to keep Randall, though.

414
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,070
Get off me!

415
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,030
You can't save them all.

416
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,830
Boyd, let's go! We gotta get out of here!

417
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,816
Fuck you! Fuck you!

418
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,720
- Motherfuckers.
- Fuck you!

419
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,810
Boyd? Boyd, don't you
leave me, you piece of shit!

420
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,076
Apply pressure right here.

421
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,770
Okay. All right. Good.

422
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,836
- Good. Okay. Good.
- Yeah?

423
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,836
Hey, hey. Are you sure you've got this?

424
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,046
Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

425
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,756
Sit here.

426
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,757
Hold her legs down.

427
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:21,006
Okay. Okay. I got it.

428
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,846
Keep her still.

429
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,016
- Come on.
- Okay. Yeah.

430
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,056
Little sting.

431
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,766
I know. I know. I know.

432
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,726
Shit. Okay. Let me see.

433
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,066
- Okay.
- Okay. Let me see.

434
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,800
Bite down. Bite down.

435
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,856
- Hold her very still.
- Come on, Nicky.

436
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,906
Here we go.

437
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,116
All right. Here we go.

438
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,986
- I know. I know.
- You got this.

439
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,970
- All right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

440
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Okay. I think I got it.

441
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,940
Okay.

442
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,860
Okay. I got it.

443
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,046
Yeah.

444
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,070
Good job.

445
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,806
There's a woman in the ambulance.

446
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,136
There were two paramedics
outside, and I don't know

447
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,080
where she is, but this
is probably 20 minutes...

448
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,840
It's okay.

449
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,116
- My god! Yes, yes, yes!
- That's it. That's it.

450
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,946
- Yes! Thank you!
- All right. Can you get up?

451
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,956
- Yes.
- Yeah?

452
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,916
Henry, let's go. Let's go, Henry.

453
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,460
- And you? Can you walk?
- I think so.

454
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,980
Come on. Come on. I got you. I got you.

455
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,190
You okay?

456
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,966
- I got him!
- My god! Hurry!

457
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,926
I got him. I got him. I got
him. I got him. Come here.

458
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,096
Come here.

459
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,186
I got you. I got you.

460
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,000
Let's go.

461
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,130
There you go. Come on.

462
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:03,180
There you go. Close that door.

463
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,180
You okay?

464
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,850
Look.

465
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,230
Bad idea.

466
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,926
Hey, what happened?

467
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,200
It was a long night.

468
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,990
For everyone, it seems.

469
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,210
I fucking told you.

470
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,986
Donna, can we

471
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,090
you can. I'll put you in a room upstairs.

472
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,946
Are you okay?

473
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,100
Yeah. Come on.

474
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,256
That poor girl.

475
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,166
Nicky's gonna be all right.

476
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,006
No. I'm not talking about Nicky.

477
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,176
I'm talking about Fatima.

478
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,290
That horrible bird.

479
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,290
What if it was a sign?

480
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,170
What's wrong?

481
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,130
Am I awake?

482
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,980
Where are you going?

483
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,080
Help me.

484
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,040
- Please!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

485
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,116
Can you see anything?

486
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,036
No.

487
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,180
What if they don't come back?

488
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,166
Don't think like that.

489
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,126
They'll come back.

490
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,126
Julie, what happened to you?

491
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:31,030
What do you mean?

492
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,266
Ever since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

493
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,186
you've been different.

494
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,040
Are you sure you're okay?

495
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,170
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

496
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,156
I don't believe you.

497
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,326
You know I'm not a baby anymore.

498
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,390
You can tell me things.

499
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,310
You wanna know the truth?

500
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,070
I'm really scared.

501
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,346
I saw things that I
don't really understand.

502
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,330
There's things that I
can't even remember.

503
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,346
All I remember is being more scared

504
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,380
than I've ever been in my entire life.

505
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,210
And that's the truth.

506
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,140
I haven't told anybody but you.

507
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,260
I'm trying really hard to be okay.

508
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,156
Can I help?

509
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,206
Hey, I'm the big sister here.

510
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,310
I'm the one who takes care of you.

511
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:50,046
If they don't come back, it'll just be us.

512
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,410
We have to start taking care
of each other from now on.

513
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,106
They'll come back.

514
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,146
So, the rod was through his eye?

515
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,106
Well, only when he was on the tree.

516
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,406
When he walked up to
me with a skull full of blood,

517
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,196
it was just a... a bloody, empty socket.

518
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,576
Jesus.

519
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,286
Yeah. So, that's what
my life's been like lately.

520
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,166
How long has this been going on for?

521
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,166
The hallucinating?

522
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,216
Pretty much since I got here.

523
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,176
Do you remember that day I
took you down to the root cellar,

524
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,426
told you I saw that
symbol up on the ceiling?

525
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,450
You thought I was crazy?

526
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,500
Tian-chen saw me in the diner.

527
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,356
I was drawing the symbol over
and over again, losing my mind,

528
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,276
and first, she made me tea.

529
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,446
And then she took me
back into the storage room,

530
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,350
and she... She pulled out this.

531
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,400
Still have no idea how
she knew it was there.

532
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
My mom knew every
inch of that storage room.

533
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,176
You know, I thought I was smart enough

534
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,490
to figure this place out, and.

535
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,370
I should have... Fuck.

536
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,290
She really liked you,
you know? My mom.

537
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,236
I think she tolerated
me more than anything.

538
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,340
No, no, no. I mean, she really...

539
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,446
She only frowned at
people that she liked.

540
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,560
I mean, the people that
she didn't, she just... ignored.

541
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,306
When you finish that letter,

542
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,490
tell her we all say hi.

543
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,436
- Jesus.
- Shh.

544
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,510
It's okay. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

545
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,276
Are you sure those things you saw today

546
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,390
were hallucinations?

547
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,370
This belonged to Mr. Gerber.

548
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,266
He always smelled like onions.

549
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,436
They grow wild in the woods,

550
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,630
so he would pick them and eat them raw.

551
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,660
This was from delores.

552
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,420
She always cried lots.

553
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,520
What's wrong?

554
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,666
Nothing for Christopher.

555
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,610
Who was Christopher?

556
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,587
He was our friend.

557
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:01,676
He... he was nice,

558
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,546
but then he started seeing the symbol,

559
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,700
and then he started getting scary.

560
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,580
What?

561
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,486
No. This was a mistake. I
don't want to do this anymore.

562
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,406
- Victor.
- No! I said no!

563
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,486
- Victor!
- I said no!

564
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,446
- Victor!
- No, no, no, no!

565
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,536
- Victor!
- No, no!

566
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,326
- Victor! Victor!
- No, no!

567
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,616
Hey, hey.

568
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,440
Shh. It's okay.

569
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,570
You don't have to be afraid.

570
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,610
I'm the scariest person
in town, remember?

571
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,740
I know what's missing.

572
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,710
Hello, Victor!

573
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,540
His name was Jasper.

574
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,790
I

575
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,630
I left him.

576
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,590
I just.

577
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,366
I just fucking left.

578
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,786
My god, Boyd.

579
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,366
You know, I couldn't... I...
I tried to save everybody.

580
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,496
Like, what the fuck was Tabitha doing

581
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,240
in the back of that
goddamn ambulance? I...

582
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,756
How did she...

583
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,570
Are you sure he... he's
really Victor's father?

584
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,790
Jim, I stood in the house
that Victor grew up in.

585
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,596
Jesus.

586
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,556
His mother, Miranda,

587
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,686
she saw this place
before she even got here.

588
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,710
She had these paintings and.

589
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,576
I think that was the
reason why I was sent there.

590
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,656
The little boy in the tower

591
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,456
I think he wanted me to see something,

592
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,666
find something.

593
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,796
And I tried.

594
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,466
I just... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

595
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,756
Hey, hey, hey. You have
nothing to be sorry about.

596
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,756
You are back, and you are safe.

597
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,540
And that is all that matters.

598
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,516
Okay?

599
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,790
But what if that was our
only chance to go home?

600
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,446
- Hey.
- Is she all right?

601
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,656
Shit. Nicky?

602
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,446
What's wrong with her?

603
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,496
No.

604
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,786
My god. What is...
she's bleeding internally.

605
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,626
The bullet must have
done more damage than I

606
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,546
- god.
- Nicky, Nicky, Nicky, stay with me, okay?

607
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,506
You're okay. Hey, hey, hey.

608
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,546
- Nicky?
- Come on, Nicky.

609
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,610
Shit.

610
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Come on.

611
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,466
Nicky, stay with me! Nicky?

612
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,516
- No.
- No.

613
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,620
Come on.

614
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,500
Shit. Come on.

615
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,840
Come on. Come on.

616
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,840
Nicky?

617
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
No.

618
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,706
You see what you've done?

619
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,546
It was an accident.

620
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,586
What's wrong with you, officer?

621
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,716
Something scares you,
you just start shooting?

622
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,846
- Is that right?
- I'm sorry.

623
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,596
You're sorry? You're sorry?

624
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,676
Come tell Nicky you're sorry!

625
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,556
- Come on now.
- Get the fuck off me!

626
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,686
- Hey!
- Listen!

627
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,846
You come with me right fucking now!

628
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,670
God! God!

629
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,696
Shut the door.

630
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,736
Look. I'm not really in the
mood for a lecture right now,

631
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,680
so if all we're gonna do... hey, Donna?

632
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,536
Why is this happening?

633
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,796
Why is it just one thing
after another after another?

634
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,740
Why can't they stop?

635
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,636
Why can't they leave us alone?

636
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,806
I don't know. I don't know.

637
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:21,870
Boyd, I am so fucking scared.

638
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,606
I'm so fucking scared.

639
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,800
All right.

640
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,680
Jasper belonged to Christopher.

641
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,906
He used to be so much fun.

642
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,770
Christopher would make us all laugh.

643
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,836
And people didn't laugh much back then,

644
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,990
so it was very nice that we could.

645
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,926
But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

646
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,806
and he changed.

647
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,830
He didn't make us laugh anymore.

648
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,646
I remember Christopher started

649
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,680
spending more and more time alone.

650
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,760
And one day...

651
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,750
Jasper's the one who
can tell us why it happened.

652
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,970
Thanks.

653
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,706
I was so mean to her the other day.

654
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,706
Nah.

655
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,756
Every single person in this
house has been on edge lately.

656
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,796
Yeah, but I just think I'm
gonna sit with her for a little bit.

657
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,926
Yeah. Do you want me to stay?

658
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,886
No. I think I want to do this alone.

659
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,806
Okay.

660
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,750
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

661
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,750
Okay.

662
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,806
Better fuckin' days.

663
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,040
Hear, hear.
