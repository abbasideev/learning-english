[Marielle]
Nicky, stay with me, okay?

5

Sheriff Boyd,
I can't take back what I did.

6

- You killed someone!
- I...

7

And you left two people
to die in that ambulance!

8

- I know!
- One of whom

9

you handcuffed
to a fucking wall!

10

I am sorry.

11

[Henry]
Miranda started seeing things.

12

She said it was like

13

she'd been chosen
to free the children.

14

I guess you've
been chosen now, too.

15

Miranda...
she's the only one who had

16

a connection to this place
long before she arrived.

17

[Tabitha] What is this?

18

Did you see three red stones?

19

How did you...

20

When I was a little girl,

21

I would have the same
nightmare over and over again.

22

It wasn't just Miranda.
I saw this place, too.

23

[Randall] <i>If you'd seen
the things I've seen...</i>

26

What are you talking about?

27

What do you think
I'm talking about, Boyd?

28

When me, Julie and Marielle,
wherever we were...

29

Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

30

Well, I don't think
that's the worst thing

31

that can happen to you here.

32

I feel like something
is watching me.

33

Is that her?
She looks scary.

34

[gasps]

35

<i>Help me, Elgin.
I can save all of you.</i>

36

Donna, I was told
I can't have kids.

37

What's happening right now
is medically impossible.

38

You're gonna have a baby

39

that you were told
you could never have!

40

With all you've seen, you can't
wrap your head around a miracle?

41

[beeping]

42

I don't see anything.

43

[Fatima] That's impossible.

44

You barely looked!
Just keep looking!

45

You're not pregnant.

46

And how long have these
cravings been going on for?

47

Um, about a week maybe?

48

Guys, what is happening to me?

49

Um, well, I mean,
if we were anywhere else,

50

I'd say your body's
exhibiting signs

51

of a psychosomatic pregnancy.

52

And what is that?

53

It's a fairly rare condition

54

where your body
believes it's pregnant.

55

It shows all the early
signs and symptoms of...

56

"Hysterical pregnancy."

57

Isn't that what
they used to call it?

58

Hey, no one here thinks
you're being hysterical.

59

It wasn't so long ago

60

that Boyd had worms under his
skin that no one else could see.

61

We're not ruling
anything out here.

62

And, I mean, you very well
could have been pregnant...

63

I am pregnant.
It's still there! I can feel it.

64

Here.
Just take a sip of this.

65

- I don't fucking want that!
- [glass shatters]

66

[Kristi] Okay...

67

Sorry. I'm sorry.

68

[Kristi]
It's been a long day.

69

Your body's been
under a lot of stress.

70

[exhaling deeply]

71

How about you stay the night?
Ellis can stay, too, and...

72

- I wanna go home.
- [Kristi] Fatima...

73

I just wanna go back to my room.

74

It's raining outside, okay?
I don't want you walking...

75

You're worried about
the fucking rain?!

76

Okay.

77

- Hey.
- Fatima!

78

Hey, you go. You should go.

79

Fatima!

80

- [Fatima] I wanna go home!
- [door opens]

81

I'm gonna go stay
the night at Colony House.

82

At least I can
get an IV started.

83

- Yeah.
- [door closes]

84

You should've told me about all
of that before the ultrasound.

85

- It wasn't my place.
- Really, Boyd?

86

Now you wanna stand on ceremony?

87

That was information I could
have used before the exam.

88

I can't help,
if I'm in the dark!

89

You wanna yell at me?

90

Fine, but once you're done,
can we maybe figure out

91

what we're gonna do now?

92

I don't know
what we're gonna do.

93

I don't know what's wrong.
Either way, she...

94

she has something growing inside
of her that we can't see,

95

or this place has
finally gotten to her head

96

and made her believe
she's pregnant.

97

Okay. Then, how do we
figure out which one it is?

98

I don't know, Boyd.

99

Then how do we help her?

100

I have no fucking clue
how to help her.

101

Okay. Then, do your fucking job
and figure it out!

at the Sheriff's Station,

when the bus pulled into town,
you... you broke down in my arms.

Do you remember that? You said
you couldn't take it anymore...

202

This has nothing
to do with that!

203

Okay, so then tell me
what am I supposed to do?

Believe me!

205

Look, look, okay.

206

Just... Ow!

207

Ugh!

208

Look!

209

Just...

210

I have been measuring every
single day since I found out.

211

- You just need to stop.
- And my stomach...

212

And my stomach
is getting bigger!

213

- Baby, it's not...
- Look! Look at it! Look!

If this is in my head,
how do you...

how do you explain
my body changing?

it's getting stronger.

they're getting stronger.

219

Please.

220

- I'm angry all the time.
- It's okay.

221

If there's nothing there,

222

if the baby isn't real,
that means that it's me.

223

[crying]

224

I told her it was a miracle.

225

Yeah, we all, uh...
[clears throat]

226

We all got a little excited.

[sighs]

228

You're sure there's no way
Kristi missed anything?

229

Donna, there was nothing there.

230

Nothing that showed up
on that machine anyway.

231

So, the way Kristi sees it,
either there's something there,

232

like the worms
that were under my skin,

233

or this place
finally got to her.

234

Like Abby.

235

Yeah, like Abby.

236

Look, if you're thinking about

237

things you could
have done different...

238

- No, it's not that.
- Well, it should be.

239

Look, if it's
some kind of fucked-up

240

worms-under-the-skin type thing,

241

then that's a bridge
we're gonna have to cross.

242

But if it's psychological,

243

if she's anywhere
near the place Abby was in,

244

then we need to figure out
a way to bring her back.

245

Okay, well, let's just...

246

make sure this stays between us.

247

And then what?

248

I'm gonna have a talk
with Kristi later.

249

Hopefully,
she'll have had time to, uh...

250

To what?

251

I don't know. Look.

252

Look, I...
I'm just telling you

253

'cause you and I promised not
to keep secrets from each other,

254

and she's
living under your roof.

255

Yeah, yeah.

256

About that...
While we're figuring it out,

257

I don't think it's a good idea
that they stay at Colony House.

258

What?!

259

Look, I am gonna
be there for them,

260

for you, every step of the way.

261

But the truth is, there are
two possibilities here,

262

and each one poses
a different kind of threat

263

to the people of that house.

264

I have to think about
everyone here, Boyd,

265

no matter how much
I wanna help you guys.

266

Okay, I, uh...
I guess I can, uh...

267

make some space at
the Sheriff's Station.

268

- I gotta...
- Oh, Boyd, come on.

269

No, we're good!
We're good!

270

I'm not saying
it has to be today.

271

I'm just saying it's something
we have to consider.

272

I get it!
You're not wrong! Okay?

273

You and me, we're okay.
Just... I just...

274

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

275

This one's all right.

276

Let me help you.
If we get going soon,

277

we should be able to make
pretty good time back to town.

278

Whatever was
banging around last night

279

sure as hell didn't sound like
those things back in town.

280

Whatever it was,

this place is in the rearview.

Everything's okay.

290

What the hell's going on?

291

[Jade]
Listen, it's okay.

292

All right? It was my idea.
She needed to come out here.

293

she keeps seeing need her help.

he went down a rabbit hole

417

You have to understand,
uh, things are...

418

things are a little different
when you first get here.

419

I mean, you show up,
and you think to yourself,

420

"I'm gonna figure this out.
All these other people,

421

they may have given up,
they may have accepted it.

422

But me?
I'm gonna figure this out.

423

I'm gonna be the one

426

427

Pass. [stammers]

431

Right. You're not the type to
just accept the world as it is.

432

What?

433

I've had this
conversation before,

434

and I've been
on the other side of it.

435

The thing you come
to realize is that...

436

every... [sighs]
question you're asking

437

has been asked before.

438

Every theory that you have,

439

someone else has had
before you, and at some point,

440

...you either adapt
or you lose your mind.

441

So, that's what you did?
You adapted?

442

Well, me,
I didn't really have a choice.

443

When I first got here,

444

I was so busy taking care
of my dad that I was just...

445

Your... dad?

446

He passed away.

447

And your mom... she...

448

she used to run the diner?

449

Mm-hmm.

450

You lost both your parents here?

451

Yeah. [scoffs]

452

I'm really sorry.

453

Thanks.

454

You're... welcome.

455

Um, what about, uh,
what about you?

456

You have any... you have
a family back home?

457

Uh, no, not...

458

Um... not really.

459

Right.

460

Um, the good news is that
we have the talismans,

461

and they keep us safe at night.

So, you know... I mean,
that wasn't always the case.

463

What the hell did
people do before?

464

465

as best they could.

466

467

Yeah. I wasn't here then.

The talismans.

Boyd. He, uh...

472

found 'em out
in the forest one night.

473

So, that's why he acts like
the God king of the world.

474

It's, uh, not like that.

475

You sure?

476

I mean, no offense,
the guy's kind of a dick.

You, uh, didn't exactly

He took my gun.

Can you blame him?

You know, I'm gonna have to
carry the weight of that...

for the rest of my life.

I know that.
But for him to f...

You know, I don't want your
fucking fresh clothes, okay?!

488

No offense, really!
I don't want your tea.

your adapt-or-die philosophy.

I don't give a shit

Whatever you say, "Sheriff."

I'd ask you what

I stood there today in his room,

...I had a thought I'll never
forgive myself for. [sniffs]

608

I wished I had never come here,

609

I wished Tabitha
had never found me,

610

because it was easier
when I thought he was dead.

611

It was only for a second.

612

What kind of father
thinks that about his child?

613

Here.

614

Yeah. [sniffles]

615

- Mm.
- [glass clatters]

616

Are these the same ones
from your dream?

617

It's not just the stones;
it's everything. It's...

618

It's how it feels.

619

I still remember the fear
when I was running.

620

I started over there

621

and came to hide
behind the rocks.

622

Which one?

623

This one.

624

And then what?

625

Whatever was
making everyone scream

626

was on the other side
of this rock.

627

And I would look up and...

628

What?

629

I would wake up
every single time.

630

Okay, let's say you

631

actually did see this
place before we came here.

632

Yeah, like...
like Miranda did.

633

[Jim]
How does that help?

634

Maybe Aristotle got it wrong.

635

You know, free will
and determinism, it's...

636

Miranda said she was chosen.

637

Right?

638

If seeing this place,
you know, visions, dreams...

639

...if that's the proof...

640

and you saw this place
as a child?

641

You never really had
a chance, did you?

642

[Jim] What...
What do you mean?

643

If fate exists,
if you were destined

644

to come to this place
since you were a child...

645

...then, one way or another,

646

you were always gonna come
to that tree in the road.

647

How's Fatima doing?

648

Oh. [clears throat]

649

She's, uh... She's good.

650

You know, we're just taking
things one step at a time.

651

You don't have to pretend.

652

She told me about the rotten
food, about the cravings.

653

I realize
you don't know me very well.

654

But if you need anything,
I'm here.

655

We did an ultrasound last night.

656

There was a machine
on the ambulance.

657

And? Is the baby okay?

658

There is no baby.

659

When Kristi examined her,
she looked.

660

There was nothing there.

661

So, it's either there's
something inside of her

662

that isn't human,
that a machine can't see,

663

or this place
has just broken her mind.

664

[kettle whistling]

665

I just...
I can't lose her. I just...

666

[kettle whistle slows and stops]

667

You haven't lost her.

668

She's still here, Ellis.

669

A good friend once said to me,

670

"Enjoy every moment,

671

and don't grieve the living
before they're gone."

672

And that's what I told my family

673

when I got my diagnosis.

674

Are you afraid?

675

Of dying?

676

Sure, at first, I was.

677

And then I got angry.

678

And one day, I realized
just how small life is,

679

how it all goes by so fast.

680

You start to wonder
how it could be anything

681

but the beginning
of some grand adventure,

682

or maybe it's the middle,

683

but I don't think it's the end.

684

Not anymore.
Once I realized that,

685

things didn't seem so scary.

686

None of us get to stay forever.

687

I don't need forever.
I just...

688

Whatever I can do,
whatever you need...

689

well, it may not be much,
but I'm here.

690

Mm?

691

I'm sorry, but why?
I mean, you barely know us.

692

I'm old, and I have cancer.

693

I like a good love story.
That work for you?

694

Yeah. Yeah, that...
that works fine.

- Ellis! Hey!
- Thank you for all your help...

749

Hey, hey,
what the hell is going on?

750

Your son decided to come in here
and root the medicine cabinet!

751

Yeah, that's because that
ambulance has plenty

752

of emergency medications!

753

This isn't fucking aspirin
we're talking about!

754

Things that can make
her stay calm, okay?

755

These are powerful
anti-psychotics!

756

You have no idea what kind
of damage that could cause!

757

Okay, so what then? What? What?
We're just gonna do nothing?

758

Okay, you're not the one
that's sitting there,

759

- watching her go to pieces!
- No, I'm the doctor, okay?

760

And it is my job to use my brain
and not my emotions

761

- when making decisions.
- All right.

Ellis, those pills in your hands
could make things a lot worse.

763

Give them back to me.

am I supposed to be afraid of?

how to help her.
