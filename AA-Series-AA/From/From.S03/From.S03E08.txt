[Boyd] <i>Previously on</i> From...

2

- [screaming]
- What's wrong with her?!

3

- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

4

Since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

5

you've been different.

6

Do you feel that?

7

We should go.

8

You feel it.

9

You do.

10

What the hell's going on?

11

It was my idea.
She needed to come out here.

12

Mom saw this place
when she was little.

13

There might be a part of you
that wants so badly

14

for all of this to make sense.

15

This wasn't just
a random nightmare, Jim.

16

This was a dream
I had for months.

17

Miranda said she was chosen.

18

If you were destined
to come to this place,

19

then one way or another,

20

you were always gonna come
to that tree in the road.

21

He knows things.

22

I heard him tell Christopher
a story about this place once.

23

We'll make him tell it again.

24

Can I go in your basement?

25

I need <i>him</i> to tell me a secret.

26

<i>Help me, Elgin.</i>

27

<i>I can save all of you.</i>

28

[camera shutter clicking]

29

[ominous music playing]

30

Is this really where it happens?

31

Whatever is inside me,
it's getting stronger.

32

The cravings...
they're getting stronger.

33

- I'm angry all the time.
- It's okay.

34

- Aah!
- Fatima, it's gonna be okay.

35

- I said go!
- [gasps]

36

Help!

37

What have I done?
What have I done?!

38

[crow cawing]

39

Come on.

40

Have a seat.

41

Have a seat.
Tell me what happened.

42

We were in the...
the greenhouse.

43

I was...

44

And... and I didn't wanna eat
those rotting things anymore.

45

[cries] Tillie came in,

46

and she was trying to help me,

47

and I felt this wave of...
of anger come over me,

48

like this rage.

49

It was like this thing...

50

inside me. It was...

51

It was like I was there,
but I wasn't.

52

And... and I felt my hand
reach for the shears.

53

And I couldn't stop.

54

[breathing shakily]
I didn't wanna do it.

55

- There was nothing I could do.
- Here's what we're gonna do.

56

You're gonna
stay out here tonight.

57

And come morning,

58

Ellis and I are gonna
figure out the best way...

59

We're gonna figure out
how we move forward.

60

There's no way forward.

61

Hey. Look at me.

62

You are my family.

63

And what happened back there,

64

we are gonna
find a way to deal with it.

65

Okay?

66

Fatima.

67

Okay?

68

Okay.

69

If you need to eat...

70

No, no, no, no. Please...
Please take that away.

71

Look, whatever
is happening to you...

72

Take it away!

73

...I don't want it
to get any worse.

74

So, you need to eat, you eat.

75

What about Tillie?

76

We just...
I left her there.

77

- I left her there.
- [Boyd] Okay.

78

- My God, I left her there.
- Listen to me, listen.

79

We're gonna have to
let someone find her.

80

Oh, my God. [crying]

81

No. No, no, no. I know. Hey.
Look at me, look at me.

82

Look, I need you to be strong
right now, okay?

83

I need you to be...
Ellis needs you to be strong.

84

Please.

85

[breathing shakily]

86

That's right.

87

Okay.

88

Now it's getting dark.

89

This door stays closed,
no matter what.

90

Right.

91

We're gonna be okay.

[man in distance]
We're coming in two minutes!

118

Hey, uh...
[clears throat]

119

I'll, uh, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

120

Hey, Ethan, Ethan...

121

[footsteps ascend stairs]

122

[sighs]

123

[bottle clatters]

[clatter in distance]

125

[clatter continues]

126

Hello?

127

[grunt]

128

Okay.

129

Hello?!

130

Hey. Uh, sorry.
[chuckles]

131

Who the fuck are you?

132

Sorry, I'm, um...
Henry Kavanaugh.

133

You probably know my son.

134

Victor?

135

Oh.

136

Right.

137

Nice to meet you.

138

Same.

139

Uh... it's quite
the set-up you've got.

140

You making any progress?

141

No, not really.

142

I hope you don't mind if
I grab a little pick-me-up.

143

Help yourself.

144

Cheers.

145

[sighs]

146

[coughing]

147

[humming]

148

[door opens]

149

We need help!

150

Help! I need help!

151

- Somebody get Donna!
- What is it?

152

[man] It's Tillie!

153

Shit.

154

[camera shutter clicks]

155

[ominous music playing]

156

I'm going home.

157

Have you seen
Kristi or Marielle?

158

- Uh, no.
- Can you just tell them

159

I said thank you
for letting me stay the night?

160

I don't get a thank you?

161

Thank you, Randall,
for letting me stay at the place

162

that Marielle and Kristi
are letting you stay at.

163

You're welcome.

164

We should go back.

165

To that place, whatever it is,
we should...

166

we should go back
and check it out.

167

What?

168

Well, typically,
when a place makes the hair

169

on the back of my neck stand up,

170

it's enough for me to stay away.

171

Yeah, but we both felt it.

172

Right? What if it can, like,

173

I don't know, help
with whatever's happening...

174

And what if
it makes it worse? Huh?

175

Look...

176

There is nothing here

177

that wants to help us.

178

Okay? Nothing.

179

So, stay the fuck
away from that place.

180

Right?

181

Remember what I said.
Anybody asks,

182

you and Fatima were
with me last night. Okay?

183

What if we just tell them
the truth

184

and explain what happened?

185

- Ellis...
- That it wasn't her fault.

186

I know. I know.

187

Maybe some of those people
will understand that.

188

There's no version of us
explaining this away.

189

Look, they're
gonna put her in the Box.

190

I'm not gonna let that happen.
Look at me.

191

I'm not gonna let that happen.
Get yourself together.

192

Go in there,
get up to your room,

193

put some things in a bag.
Don't pack too much,

194

just enough for her
to spend a couple days

195

out there at the shack.

196

And what are you gonna do?

197

I'm gonna... [clears throat]

198

- [Kenny] Boyd!
- ...buy us some time. Hey!

199

[Kenny] Hey, uh...
We found something.

200

Anyone see anything?

201

Uh, not that we've...

202

Not that we've heard so far.

203

Any idea when this happened?

204

Could've been this morning.
It could've been last night.

205

There's not a whole
lot of people coming in,

206

with the snow and everything.

207

[Acosta] Those things
that come out at night,

208

I'm guessing they don't
use gardening shears?

209

No.

210

We should talk to
everyone in the house.

211

[Kenny] Boyd?

212

Yeah, that's a good idea.
Start talking to people.

213

I'll take Ellis out
to walk the road.

214

- Walk the road?
- This could've been done

215

by people we know
or people we don't.

216

We need to rule out
the possibility

217

we had
any new arrivals yesterday

218

that we don't know about.

219

- [Boyd] All right?
- Yeah.

220

Yeah. Hey.

221

I know,
you're not my deputy, but...

222

Yeah, no, I got it.

223

We'll get the interviews
started.

224

Yeah.

225

Hey, Sheriff?

226

We good?

227

Let's find out who did this.

228

[gasps]

229

Hey, you okay?

230

Hell, we're gonna
have to talk to Sara.

231

- It wasn't her.
- [Donna] You don't know that.

232

And I am not the only person
who's gonna be asking about her.

233

[breathing shakily]

234

If you don't think
she did it, fine.

235

Then, we'll just have to...

236

go talk to her and make sure.

237

- Listen...
- No, no, no, you listen.

238

Hiding every night from
those things, that's one thing.

239

But this? This is something

240

that people are gonna
have to blame someone for.

241

And if we don't figure out who,

242

then it's gonna be Sara,
whether she did it or not.

243

Okay.

244

You get things
straightened out here,

245

then meet me at the station, and
we will talk to her together.

246

[Sara] "Hello, Victor.

247

Do you want to play today?
I can tell you a secret."

248

No, no, not... not like that!
I just... I told you!

249

It doesn't
sound like that, Sara!

250

I'm doing the best that I can!

251

I'm trying
everything that I know!

252

I don't know
what you want, Victor!

253

- [mumbling]
- [thudding]

254

- Hey, hey, hey!
- [Victor] No!

255

No! He d...
he doesn't... you need...

256

he needs to talk,
and you're not doing it right!

257

I'm doing the best that I can!

258

No, you're not
doing it good enough!

259

No, you're not good enough.
You're not good enough!

260

- Victor! Hey!
- You're not good enough!

261

- Hey, don't! Stop! Stop!
- You're not good enough!

262

- You're not good enough!
- Stop! Stop!

263

Look, I know you want
all this to mean something,

264

and this place has you
convinced that you need

265

to save these children.

266

It's got you trying to fix
something that we can never...

267

[sighs]

268

Do you know why
the phone is off the wall?

269

Because it rang the other day,

270

and the voice on the other end
said his name was Thomas.

271

What?

272

Something here
knows things about us,

273

and it knows
which buttons to push.

274

[knock on door]

275

[exhales]

276

[knocking continues]

277

I'm sorry.

278

I know I shouldn't
be here, but...

279

Victor is in my basement,
and he's in really bad shape.

280

He said he only wants
to talk to you.

281

I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

282

Just wait there.
I'll get my coat.

283

I have to go.

284

[Elgin] Hello?

285

[door closes]

286

- Hey.
- [Elgin gasps]

287

If you're looking for drugs,
you're in the wrong spot.

288

Oh, no, no.

289

Uh, no, I was...
just looking for a Band-Aid.

290

- Oh.
- I cut my foot.

291

Mm. You better not
let Kristi or Marielle

292

find you rooting
through their shit.

293

You hear about Tillie?

294

Yeah.

295

It's fucked up.

296

Hey. I'm sorry
I was so hard on you

297

on the bus that day.

298

I guess you were right.

299

We should've turned around.

300

Sorry I, uh, threw up
all over your shirt.

301

[chuckles] Yeah.

302

[door opens]

303

[door closes]

304

[Sara] Victor?

305

Oh. Oh, you're here.

306

- [Tabitha] Hi, Victor. Hi.
- Good. Come.

307

Hey.

308

[grunts]
You sit... come sit here.

309

- Okay.
- There. Take this.

310

Okay.

311

- Okay.
- Victor, what are we...

312

You were there. You were there
when I remembered Eloise,

313

so you're the one
that can make him talk.

314

Okay, Victor, I'm so sorry.

315

I don't know...
I don't understand.

316

He needs to tell me!
You need to make him tell <i>me.</i>

317

[Tabitha]
Tell you what, Victor?

318

[Victor] The secrets
that he told Christopher

319

'cause he can help us.

320

[Tabitha] I'm sorry, honey.
He's... he's just a doll.

321

[Victor] No!
No, you have to be the one!

322

You have to be the one!

323

- Okay, okay!
- You have to be the one!

324

- [Tabitha] Victor! Hey! Hey!
- You have to be the one!

325

- You have to be the one!
- Hey! Victor, stop it!

326

- Stop it! Don't do that!
- You have to be the one.

327

Calm down.
Don't do that, Victor, please.

328

Shh. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

329

Look at me, Victor.
It's okay. You're okay.

330

- [Tabitha] You're okay.
- Okay.

331

- It's okay.
- Yeah.

332

Do you want to draw a picture?

333

No. No, it doesn't work
like that.

334

See, the pictures
always remembered

335

so that I didn't have to.

336

But I never drew one,

337

so now it's gone, and I can't...

338

I can't remember.

339

No. No, okay, okay.
First of all, sit down.

340

It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. Sit down, okay?

341

It's okay, Victor.

342

Just sit down.

343

It's okay, Victor.

344

Nothing is gone.
Nothing's gone.

345

It's okay. Um...

346

Tell me about...
tell me about the doll.

347

His name is Jasper.

348

Jasper? Okay.
Uh, tell me about Jasper.

349

I heard him once,

350

telling Christopher things
that we need to know.

351

But I don't remember.

352

[Tabitha] Hey, it's okay.
Victor, look at me.

353

- But...
- Look at me.

354

We'll remember together,

355

just like last time.

356

- Okay.
- We can do this together, okay?

357

- Okay.
- Okay.

358

Yeah. [sniffs]

359

Hello?

360

Anyone home?

361

Hey.

362

Uh... how were things
at the settlement?

363

Uh, not great.

364

Oh.

365

Listen, your brother's upstairs.

366

Would you mind
hanging with him for a bit?

367

- Well, where are you going?
- Something I gotta take care of.

368

Okay?

369

- But...
- [door opens]

370

[door closes]

371

[knock on door]

372

[door opens]

373

Ethan?

374

You doing okay?

375

- I'm fine.
- 'Cause I thought,

376

maybe you might wanna
go see something really cool.

377

My wife had visions
of this place.

378

Yeah, I've heard.

379

I thought she was crazy.

380

I should've listened to her.

381

Well... shoulda,
woulda, coulda, right?

382

What exactly makes you think

383

you're gonna be
the one to figure this out?

384

I imagine a lot of pretty
smart people have tried.

385

- [door opens]
- I'm smarter.

386

- Oh.
- Oh, please, come on in.

387

Make yourself at home.

388

It's done.

389

Right now.

390

Do you understand me?

391

What are we talking about?

392

Who the fuck do you think you
are dragging my wife and kid

393

out into the middle
of the woods?

394

Okay, first of all,

395

- I didn't drag anybody anywhere...
- I only wanna say this once.

396

Tabitha is not
in a good place right now.

397

She doesn't need you
filling her head with ideas

398

about how somehow,
she's this chosen savior,

399

responsible for getting
everybody home...

400

You get
your fucking hands off me!

401

Filling her head with ideas?
What is she, nine?

402

Jim, she... she came here!
She came here, okay?

403

She saw the drawings,
she recognized the, uh, s...

404

You know what? I don't need
to explain this to you.

405

All right, then,
let me explain this to <i>you.</i>

406

You are a lonely, selfish,

407

narcissistic asshole,
who doesn't give a shit

408

about anything but yourself
and your own goddamn ego.

409

If you wanna kill yourself
trying to figure this thing out,

410

be my guest.

411

But I have a family
to look out for.

412

- Mm.
- I have people

413

who mean more to me
than you will ever understand.

414

Jim, I'm getting a little tired

415

of this sanctimonious
blue-collar bullshit.

416

You wanna talk
about your family?

417

Let's talk about your family.
Of the two of us,

418

I am the only one doing
a goddamn thing to help them!

419

[scoffs]

420

Look at this!
You see this?

421

This...
this helps people!

422

No! You know
what this does?!

423

This shows people
how you are the smartest

424

fucking prick in the room!

425

So what?!

426

If it gets us home,
who gives a shit?!

427

And I'm not gonna do this.

428

I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna do this.

429

I'm not gonna waste
any more of my time.

430

Listen, if you wanna keep
your kids under lock and key,

431

more power to you.
Tabitha's a grown-up.

432

You got a problem with what
she's doing, talk to her.

433

Sorry.
We're not done here!

434

Yeah, we fucking are, Jim!

435

[grunts]

436

Well, that was
certainly productive.

437

[Ellis] Fatima?

438

Hey. Come here.

439

We're gonna get
this through this, okay?

440

Ellis, I need you and your dad
to stop saying that.

441

I killed someone.

442

How, I mean... help me.

443

No, listen to me.
Listen to me.

444

Whatever this is,

445

it's you and I.

446

We are in this together.

447

I don't care if we need
to take that talisman

448

and go live in the woods.

449

No. You don't understand.
Ellis, whatever is inside me,

450

whatever made me...
it's still there.

451

- No. Babe, hey.
- It's still there. I...

452

What if it happens again?

453

What if I... what if I...
what if I do something...

454

You... You won't. You won't.
Look at me. Look at me.

455

You won't. Okay?

456

Because you are
stronger than this.

457

Whatever this is,
we are stronger than this.

458

Okay?

459

Fatima?

460

Okay.

461

I brought you some things.

462

Some...

463

Some clothes
if you wanna change.

464

- [bag thuds]
- Hey...

465

Lucky handkerchief.
Remember?

466

I love you.

467

I love you, too.

468

Okay.

469

I'll be back soon.

470

Okay. Soon.

You mind if I give you
some unsolicited advice?

481

I don't see why not.

482

Maybe, sometimes,
when you're with your wife...

483

you should
shut the fuck up and listen.

484

Excuse me?

485

Jim, I-I look at you right now.

486

All I see is me
standing there 40 years ago.

487

I was so sure I could "fix" her.

488

[chuckles] It never occurred
to me she wasn't broken.

489

That, uh... arrogant fella
who stormed outta here?

490

He... He was right
about one thing.

491

What you're doing,

492

how tight you're
holding on to everything...

493

You may tell yourself you're
doing it for your family.

494

But you're doing it
because you're scared,

495

and you're
doing it for yourself.

496

I'm probably the only guy
in this whole place

497

who can tell you that
and say... it's true.

498

It's true.

[glass clatters]

500

Uh, you want a drink?

501

No. I don't...

502

- Oh.
- My dad was a drunk.

503

Mine, too.

504

The night my daughter was born,

505

after Tabitha fell asleep, I...

506

I went to the bar across
the street from the hospital,

507

and I asked the bartender
for the tallest glass

508

of whiskey she could pour,

509

and I stared
at that drink for hours,

510

and I promised myself I would
be a better father to my kids...

511

...a better husband
to my wife.

512

What are you doing?

513

Giving you the chance
to renew your vows.

514

Sit there as long as you like.

515

I could use the company.

516

What is this?

517

I don't know.

518

But if I tell you something,

519

can you promise that
you won't tell Mom and Dad?

520

Ever since I woke up,

521

something has been
happening in me.

522

I... I hear things
in my head.

523

What kind of things?

524

I hear people screaming.

525

And it won't stop.

526

But yesterday,

527

I was out here with Randall,
and when I saw this place...

528

...everything went quiet

529

for the first time
since I woke up.

530

But that's... good, right?

531

I don't know.

532

[inhales and exhales deeply]
I feel...

533

I feel like something...

534

Like it wants me to go in here.

535

And I don't know what to do.

536

It's just
a pile of rocks, right?

537

But I'm scared.

538

So... what do I do?

539

What?

540

All I keep thinking about
is that this sounds like

541

those stories
that you always tell us.

542

If I was a character
in one of those stories...

543

what would I do?

544

What would...

545

What would this be?

546

You're at a threshold.

It's always scary, but...

586

at hide-and-seek.

587

I could never find her,
no matter how hard I looked.

588

Okay. Um...

589

Where did you look
that day, Victor?

590

Everywhere. The bar, the diner,
the houses, the... church.

591

I looked in the church.

592

She'd never hid there before.

593

- Mm-hmm?
- She said it always scared her,

594

but I'd already
looked everywhere else.

595

That was where it happened.
That's where I saw Jasper

596

talking to Christopher
in the church!

597

We just need to know
if you saw anything.

598

I mean, did I see someone stab
the old lady

599

in the greenhouse? No.

600

What about Tillie? When was
the last time you saw her?

601

I don't know.
Yesterday morning.

602

Why aren't you guys talking
to the one person in town

603

who actually murdered someone?

604

What?

605

Oh, you don't know about Sara?
She doesn't know about Sara.

606

Look, I'm not sure why
you guys are talking to us.

607

It's pretty fuckin'
obvious who did this.

608

Okay, look, we're gonna
talk to Sara after.

609

- But for right now, let's...
- Didn't she kill your Dad?

610

The fuck are you
defending her for?

611

Goddamnit, I said no!

612

Then what is your solution?!

613

Okay, we are running
out of time, okay?!

614

Maybe...
maybe if you explain to them,

615

all right, and then give it
a little bit of time...

616

And in the meantime, what?
What?

617

You two are living
out there in a tent?

618

Yes! We'll have talismans!
We'll be safe!

619

You won't be safe from <i>her.</i>

620

So, that... is that what
you're afraid of?

621

- Whatever made her do this...
- She would never hurt me.

622

She just stabbed someone
in the fucking chest!

623

Son, listen to me!

624

I love Fatima. I do.
But we do not know what...

625

Boyd, look, I have
a whole lot of people up there

626

just ready to march on
Sara's house with torches...

627

What's going on?

It wasn't Sara.

Boyd, look,

693

Oh, my God.

694

What happened?

695

- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

696

So I took her outta town
before everyone woke up.

697

You need to bring her back.

698

I can't do that.
Not yet.

699

- Not until we...
- Until you what?

700

Manage to resurrect Tillie?

701

Look, I don't wanna...

702

I love Fatima
as though she were my own.

703

But we have a town we have
to worry about here, Boyd.

704

And if you try to hide this,
and people find out...

705

They will understand,
just like they did with Sara.

706

Is that what you think?
You think they

707

- understood about Sara?
- Yes.

708

No, no, no!
They didn't understand.

709

They accepted it.

710

People swallowed it.

711

But they certainly
did not understand it!

712

They let it go because
<i>you</i> told them they had to.

713

Great, then,
I will tell them again!

714

- It's not gonna work this time.
- Why not?

715

Because they don't
believe in you anymore.

716

Not like they did.

717

I'll tell them I did it.

718

- No, no, no!
- No, no, I'll, I'll... I did it!

719

- No, no, no, it's not enough!
- Why?

720

Because it doesn't change
that it made it happen

721

in the first place!

722

There is either something
horrible growing inside of her,

723

or else this place
has finally broken her mind!

724

Either way, it's only a matter
of time before it happens again!

725

They can stay with me.

726

[exhales heavily]

727

She won't be
a threat to anyone else.

728

I can watch her.
We can watch her.

729

No, no, no, Boyd. Boyd, you may
both want this to be okay,

730

and God knows
I want it to be okay, too.

731

But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

732

Please, don't make me do this.

733

[door closes]

734

What are you doing?

735

You're gonna need supplies.

736

[Victor] It was in the basement.
It happened in the basement.

737

When I opened the door,
I heard voices.

738

So, I was quiet,
and I wanted to get closer.

739

When I got...

740

<i>to the bottom of the stairs,</i>

741

<i>Jasper was telling secrets.</i>

742

[muted speech]

743

- [muted speech]
<i>- Christopher got angry.</i>

744

[continues, muted]

745

<i>No, no, that's not right.</i>

746

<i>It wasn't Jasper.</i>

747

[muted speech continues]

748

It was the boy in white.

749

He was the one
that was down here.

750

He who was telling secrets
to Christopher.

751

[muted] The answers to the end
are at the beginning.

752

He said, "The answers to
the end are at the beginning."

753

[boy in white, muted]
It started with the children.

754

That it started
with the children...

755

<i>- What the others did to them.</i>
- ...what the others did to them.

756

What others, Victor?

757

The people they loved.

758

The people they trusted.

759

<i>The children are born
in the dark.</i>

760

[Victor] <i>He said the children
were born in the dark.</i>

761

[boy in white, muted] And then
they were murdered in the dark.

762

And then they were murdered...
in the dark.

763

[muted] But someone
who loved them...

764

But someone who loved them...

765

<i>- ...told them a story.</i>
- ...told them a story.

766

The story gave them hope.

767

And when the children
laid on the stones,

768

they poured their hope

769

into the roots
that made the symbol,

770

and those roots became the tree.

771

The Faraway Tree.

772

The boy in white was
trying to tell Christopher

773

that to save the children...

774

he would have
to go through the tree.

775

But he wouldn't...
he wouldn't listen, and he...

776

he got angry.

777

[muted] You're a liar!
Everything lies here!

778

Christopher
wouldn't listen, so I-I...

779

What?

780

Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

781

I told my mother
what the boy in white said.

782

And that's why she left us.

783

[Elgin] Fatima?

784

It's Elgin.

785

[door creaks open]

786

You...

787

Okay, stay close, all right?
But not too close.

788

Four or five hours out,
that should be, uh, enough.

789

[Ellis] Okay.

790

And, whatever you do, you stay
off the path to the settlement.

791

Last thing we want is anybody
tripping over your tent.

792

I'm gonna leave supplies for
you at the shack twice a week.

793

You need anything,
you leave a note behind.

794

- Okay.
- You bring a pen and pad?

795

Yeah, it's in the pack.

796

And if things...

797

Look, if things get worse,
you promise me that you'll...

798

Look, um, Dad,

799

I know you don't
want me to do this,

800

but if you'd had the chance,
if you and Mom coulda ran,

801

even after she did
what she did...

802

what would you have done?

811

to be this close to town?

812

824

Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can't do that.

825

Elgin, get out of my way.

826

No, you don't understand.
You have to be here.

827

It's the only place
that the baby will be safe.

828

- There is no baby.
- Yes, there is.

It's just not yours.
