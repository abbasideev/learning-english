<i>Previously on</i> From...

2

That's why you wanted
a divorce...

3

'cause it would be easier
for you to cut and run,

4

instead of trying to put
our family back together!

5

When you're with your wife,

6

you should shut
the fuck up and listen.

7

What you're doing,

8

how tight you're
holding on to everything,

9

you're doing it
because you're scared.

10

Ever since I woke up, something
has been happening to me.

11

I hear people screaming.

12

You're at a threshold.
The hero has to be brave.

13

[voices screaming]

14

Julie! Julie!

15

It was the boy in white.

16

He was the one that was
telling secrets to Christopher.

17

Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

18

What?

19

I told my mother
what the Boy in White said.

20

Help me, Elgin.

21

I can save all of you.

22

Is this really where it happens?

23

[Fatima]
We were in the greenhouse.

24

She was trying to help me.

25

Oh, Fatima!

26

- I said go!
- [gasps]

27

I couldn't stop.
[breathing unsteadily]

28

There is either something
horrible growing inside of her

29

or else this place has
finally broken her mind.

30

But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

31

I'm gonna leave supplies for you
at the shack twice a week.

32

Fatima!

33

[Elgin] It's the only place
that the baby will be safe.

34

There is no baby!

35

Yes, there is.

36

It's just not yours.

37

Out of my way!

38

No! No, no! No! No, no!

39

Elgin! Help!

40

[Ellis] Fatima! Fatima!

41

Hey, it's getting dark.

42

I'm not going back
to town without her, Dad.

43

Listen, Ellis,
she took the talisman.

44

So what? All right,
she wouldn't just leave.

45

We don't know that.
Maybe she...

46

Hey, listen to me.
Listen to me.

47

Look, we can come back out
in the morning, okay?

48

No, I'm not leaving her
out here overnight.

49

What are you gonna do, huh?
You just gonna... You just...

50

[gasps]

51

What's wrong with your hand?

52

Nothing. Let's just, uh...
Let's just, uh...

53

let's just...
[grunts]

54

- Hey!
- [groans]

55

Dad?

56

- [groans]
- What's wrong?

57

Okay.

58

What's wrong?

59

[breathing heavily]

60

Okay, come here.

61

I got you.

62

[grunting]

63

Yeah. Watch it.

64

[door opens]

65

Hey.

66

I got you some things

67

to help you get
a little more comfortable.

68

Elgin...

69

please, just let me go.

70

You're not a prisoner here.
I told you,

71

this is for your own good.

72

Hey.

73

I'm trying to protect you.

74

Elgin, listen to me.
I saw her.

75

That thing that's
been speaking to you, I saw her.

76

What she's saying isn't true.

77

This thing inside me,
it's not good.

78

It won't do good things.
Look at what happened to Tillie.

79

That happened because
the baby was scared.

80

- Elgin...
- It was hungry.

81

You know,
you weren't feeding it.

82

Fatima,
you have to stop fighting.

83

Hey, hey, hey.
You know, wait, wait, wait.

84

Fatima, Fatima, Fatima, please.

85

Just listen. Listen.
It's okay. It's okay.

86

- [gasps in pain]
- Just sit.

87

[breathing unsteadily]

88

You need to eat.

89

The sooner you eat,
the stronger the baby will be,

90

and before you know it,
we'll be going home.

91

All of us.

92

The baby already helped us once.

93

The night I found out
you were pregnant,

94

I remembered my dream, and that
helped Boyd save the town.

95

Elgin, no.

96

It's so hungry, Fatima.

97

- Just a little.
- No.

98

Please?

99

You helped me so much
since I first got here.

100

Please let me help you.

101

No.

102

Come on.
Just a little bit.

103

Hey, Victor.

131

I don't...
I don't want to talk anymore.

I understand this

133

But if what you remember
can help us understand

134

what's happening...

135

No, it won't!
I can't... I can't help you

What happened just now?

- When you touched him?
- [Kenny] Hey!

147

I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

148

Hey, you need to... you need to
get out to the clinic.

149

Something happened
to Julie out in the woods.

150

What?

151

Yeah.

152

[door closes]

153

Okay, and just look right here.

154

Gonna check your pupils.

155

Good.

156

Is she okay?

157

Well, I don't see any signs
of trauma, so that's good.

158

I'm telling you, I'm fine.

159

See?
Nothing to worry about, okay?

160

Here.

161

- Drink this.
- Thanks.

162

Now, Julie,
can you walk me through again

163

exactly what happened?

164

There's not much to say.

165

Uh, we got to the ruins,

166

I walked inside,
and then I blacked out.

167

You don't
remember anything else?

168

I... I had
a really weird dream.

169

That's all.

170

[exhales heavily]

171

Okay, well,
I'd like to keep you overnight,

172

if that's okay with you.

173

- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
- [Kristi] Yeah.

174

'Kay, we'll give you
folks some space.

175

Thank you.

176

What were you and Ethan
doing out there?

177

It was stupid. We...

178

I went to the woods
yesterday with Randall

179

and then, we got to the ruins...

180

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. With...

181

You were out there with Randall?

182

Look, Dad, it's not like that.

183

Julie?

184

Hi, Mom.

185

What happened?
Are you okay?

186

- Yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
- I'll be right back.

187

Okay.

188

What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

189

[Julie] No.
I passed out a little.

190

What do you mean, "a little"?

191

[Julie] It's okay.

- [chittering]
- [knocking]

204

- [chittering stops]
- [groans]

205

Something I can do for you?

206

What were you and Julie
doing out in the woods?

207

What did she say we were
doing in the woods?

208

I'm asking you.

209

[door closes]

210

Look, if this is your version
of the big bad dad routine,

211

I'm not in the fucking mood,
all right?

212

After what happened with you
and Marielle and Julie...

213

She won't talk about it.

214

And I know she's
going through something that...

215

I cannot understand,
but I figured you might.

216

I was teaching her
how to drive, man.

217

- What?
- She said she didn't have

218

her learner's permit, so we
boosted the Colony House van.

219

I...

220

freaked out about something
and we ended up in the woods.

221

And the ruins that you saw?

222

Look, man,
I don't mean to be a dick,

223

but I got my own shit
going on, all right?

224

You want me to explain what
happened to us? Well, I can't.

225

And I don't know
about those fucking ruins,

226

but I told her
not to go back out there.

227

Why?

228

Because they...

229

They just felt wrong.

230

How?

231

They just fucking did, Jim.

232

That's what I got.

233

Are we done?

234

You want my advice?

235

Go get the van and teach
your kid how to drive,

236

because there is fuck all
you can do about the rest.

237

None of us are
getting out of here alive.

238

I don't accept that.

239

[door closes]

240

It's good for you.

241

Oh.

242

All right.

243

[clears throat]
Yeah.

244

Take it easy.

245

I'm fine. I'm fine.

246

All right, we need to
get you to the clinic.

247

I said I'm fine.

248

Sun's going down.
[clears throat]

249

I gotta ring that bell.

250

All right.

251

Okay. All right.
Dad, you can barely walk.

252

All right? You're not fine.
Whatever's going on with you...

253

Look, I know what's
going on with me! I...

254

What?

255

Fuck.

256

Yeah, I've known for a while.

257

Sit down.

258

- [stammers]
- Sit down.

259

- [stammers]
- Hey, Ellis, Ellis, Ellis.

260

She took the talisman.

261

Wherever she is,
wherever she went, she's safe.

262

Okay? Hey.

263

Sit down.
We need to talk.

Yeah.

our dear sweet Fatima
came into our lives.

Some of you were here then.

Many of you arrived since.

But all of you have come

We should've have taken
Ethan back to the house.

292

And miss all the fun?
Come on.

293

Who doesn't like a sleepover?

I haven't been doing

299

And if there's even a chance
that it could lead us home,

then... then I'm in.

301

All the way.

No more second-guessing,
no more pushing back.

There's something
Julie's not telling us.

304

305

How long have you known?

306

It started just before I went
out into the woods with Sara.

307

[clears throat]

308

Anyone else know?

309

Yeah. Kristi.

Kenny.

311

I didn't want to worry you.

- I'm telling you now.

Has that happened before?

Yeah, with your leg.

316

No.

Seems like it, yeah.

something else
I need to tell you.

Uh, when I was in
the barn with Tian-Chen...

323

they made me watch.

324

They made me...

...watch her die.

was a set-up to...

they wanted to break me.

What if this thing
with Fatima, with the baby...

330

No, Dad, this isn't...
this isn't because of you.

331

But you don't know that.
You don't.

332

We don't know a fucking thing,

333

and now Tillie is dead,

334

and Fatima is out there
somewhere, and...

You know, you should

Those aren't going

You can't go out there blind.
She could be anywhere.

Okay, then, we get more people.

380

- Get a search party.
- How?

How? Donna is about to tell the

You really think that people

I will talk to Donna.

Okay, great.
Let me know how that goes.

She's missing, isn't she?

I heard the voices last night

400

for the first time
since the ruins.

401

What'd they say?

402

That Fatima didn't leave on her
own, that something took her.

403

Wait. What?

404

They want you to know
that she's close.

405

She's afraid.

406

They were laughing.

407

- Why?
- Because...

408

they know you
won't find her in time.

409

They want you to know
you can't save her.

410

What the fuck?

411

Jesus Christ.

But all they do is hurt!

I want it gone!
I want all of it gone!

Victor...
Wait, just...

419

just wait!
Hold on a second. Victor!

420

- Whoa, hey. What's going on?

421

Not until you calm down.

422

I said, get out of my way!

423

Okay, yeah. Here.

[Acosta] Jesus!

Just put that down.

431

- I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
- [Kenny] Okay, fine.

432

Then put it down.

434

435

No.

436

They're...
no one's scared enough.

437

Victor, please.

438

I was... I was...

439

I was so stupid!

440

Yeah, I was...

441

Just... let me go, please.
Please!

442

If you tell us what
you need the axe for.

443

I'm gonna go chop down a tree.

444

I'm just gonna
go back to the house.

445

No, come on.
You need to eat something.

446

Come on.

447

Hey, guys.

448

Nice to see the place
up and running again.

449

Mm. I had a little help.

450

This guy helped a lot with the
cleaning and the reorganizing.

451

You know, any time you
wanna come and lend a hand,

452

I could always use a helper.

453

Well, you hear that?

454

[Jim] Hmm?

455

You know,
Kenny was really supportive.

456

Hmm.

457

I think it was hard for him

458

to see this place empty
all the time.

459

And after what happened
to Tillie,

460

I think people need
a place that feels normal.

461

- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course.

462

Did they find who did it to her?

463

Not yet.

464

Just... eat.

465

- Yeah.
- Grab something.

466

- I'll get us a couple of plates.
- Yeah.

467

468

Busy.

469

[Boyd] It's Boyd.

470

[sighs]
Come in.

471

[door opens]

472

Look, look, I know you're
upset with me, okay,

473

but there's something that...

474

I'm not gonna say anything...

475

about what Fatima did

476

because of what she
means to people here...

477

her spirit, her light.

478

I don't think
people could take it.

479

I don't think I can take it.

480

She's gone.

481

What?

482

I had her in that shed
just outside of town.

483

Ellis and I went there last
night and she was gone.

484

She left?

485

Those voices that Sara hears?

486

They said something took her.

487

That she's close by,

488

but we won't be able to
save her before it's too late.

489

She said the voices
were laughing.

490

Fuck this place.

491

Ring the bell.
We'll call a meeting.

492

[Bakta]
What can I get you?

493

What?
You don't like your food?

494

I miss Tian-Chen's pancakes.

495

Hey, where you going?

496

I'm going to the bathroom.

497

He thinks it's his fault,
what happened to me.

498

Why would he?

499

Because I asked him
what I should do,

500

if I should go
inside the ruins or not.

501

I know it was stupid. I just...

502

[sighing]
...it felt so much like

503

one of those stories he
always used to tell us,

504

and I was afraid, and
I didn't know who else to ask.

505

And no offense, but this whole

506

"perfect family
breakfast" thing,

507

I know what you're
trying to do, but it's...

508

it's not making anything better.

509

It's just making
everything worse.

510

[bell ringing]

511

- [bell ringing]
- Everybody!

512

- Come on.
- Come on!

513

[bell ringing]

514

[Julie] What's going on?

515

- I don't know.
- [bell ringing]

516

[bell ringing]

517

We're gonna need everyone
to come outside a minute.

518

- Come on.
- [chattering]

519

- Let's go.
- Mom?

520

- Come on.
- [Batka] What's happening?

521

You guys go. I'll...
I'll wait for Ethan.

522

Okay.

523

Fill in. Over here.

524

Dad, what are you doing?

525

It's okay.

526

We're okay.

527

[Kenny] Come on over.

528

[Donna] All right, everyone,
listen up!

529

What happened to Tillie,
we know you're all scared.

530

We know you want answers.

531

- [door closes]
- [Donna] I want answers too.

532

But right now,
we don't have them.

533

What's going on?

534

[Boyd] We called you
all here because...

535

Come on. Everybody's outside.

536

...look, we need your help.

537

That's...

538

Hey.

539

Fatima is missing.

540

- [Batka] What?
- Fatima's missing?

541

Nobody's, uh...

542

nobody's seen her
since last night.

543

[Donna] What we're asking for
is a search party.

544

People to scour the town,
every corner,

545

every crack,
so we can bring her home.

546

Whatever took her,
is that what killed Tillie?

547

We don't know.

548

Look, I don't have all the
information on what happened.

549

All I know is
that she's close by.

550

How do you know that?

551

I know that because
something here told us,

552

something that...

553

that wants us to know that
she's alone, that she's afraid.

554

Something that thinks that we
don't have what it takes

555

to find her.

556

Now, look, I can't
tell anybody what to do.

557

Right? But you see these here?

558

We didn't always have these.

559

When I first got here,
those things in the woods,

560

they would come out at night

561

and they would take
whoever the fuck they wanted.

562

Everybody here
was living day to day,

563

moment to moment, hour to hour.

564

We found these.

565

We proved that this place
couldn't break us.

566

Now it's trying
to break us again.

567

So you can either
lay down and die or...

568

we can say fuck you.

569

[murmurs of agreement]

570

- Fuck you!
- [murmurs of agreement]

571

We are taking our lives back!

572

[murmurs of agreement]

573

It's possible to fight back!

574

We proved it once before

575

and I am asking for your help
to prove it again.

576

[murmurs of agreement]

577

Now, look, it's your choice.

578

There's no shame in backing out.

579

Okay?

580

How are we gonna do this?

581

Great. We're gonna...

582

We're gonna pair up.

583

We're all gonna go out there

584

in groups of two,
and we're gonna cover

585

every inch of this place, okay?

586

[murmurs of agreement]

587

Okay. Okay.
Let's do it. Let's go.

588

[murmurs of agreement]

589

I have to help.
Fatima's my friend.

590

I wanna help too.

591

All right.
I'll take Ethan.

592

- [Fatima] Okay.
- You take Julie.

593

We'll cover
more ground that way.

594

Yeah. Okay.

595

Be careful.

596

You too. Come on.

597

[Boyd] Ellis.

598

Hey.

599

There are gonna be
a lot of questions.

600

Best if one of us finds her.

601

We've got a better chance
by splitting up. Okay?

602

Okay.

603

Hey.

604

We are going to find her.

605

Yeah.

606

Kenny!

607

Yeah.

608

Hey, you mind
coming out there with me?

609

Yeah, of course.

610

- Great.
- Okay.

611

Let's go.

612

Ellis.

613

You need someone to search with?

614

Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

[Donna]
Fatima! Can you hear me?!

629

I don't understand
what we're doing out here.

630

No one's forcing you to help.

631

You wanna go back
to Colony House...

632

That's not what I... Look,

633

Boyd said that something told
you guys that she was out here.

634

What does that even mean?

635

That part came from Sara.

636

Fatima!

637

Sara? The girl
who murdered people.

638

She's connected to this place

639

in ways that
are hard to understand.

640

So, you're just gonna
take her word for it?

641

What if Sara killed
Tillie and Fatima

642

and then just
made up some bullshit

643

about Fatima being held
captive in the woods somewhere?

644

That's not what happened.

645

How do you know?

646

I just do.

647

Okay. So, then, why wouldn't
this, uh, magical voice

648

just tell Sara where Fatima is?

649

Better yet, why not tell her
who killed Tillie?

650

That's not
the way it works, okay?

651

So, then,
tell me how it fucking works.

652

Okay, you know something.

653

You know something
that you're not telling me.

654

I don't understand you people.
I'm a good cop.

655

I can be an asset here,
if you just...

656

If I what? If I walk you
through the many different ways

657

this place
will fuck with your head?

658

I don't have time
for a goddamn tutorial, okay?

659

Fatima is out there.
We need to find her

660

because of what she means
to the people of this town.

661

[sighs]
Because of what she means to me.

662

If you want me to believe
that you are good at your job,

663

I need you to trust me.

664

I need you to help me.

665

Can you do that?

666

Yeah.

667

Good.

668

When this is over,
we'll talk, okay?

669

Okay.

670

[Boyd] Fatima!

671

[Kenny] Fatima!

672

[Boyd] Hey, so, you're up
at Colony House now, huh?

673

Yep.

674

I been meaning to come up there
and look in on you.

675

I just, uh...

676

It's fine.
You've got, uh...

677

You got bigger things
to worry about right now.

678

Yeah, always are bigger things.

679

Yeah.

680

Hey, Kenny.

681

Look, I realize,
uh, you and me...

682

things are never
gonna be the same again.

683

- Boyd, we don't have to...
- No, I...

684

I lied to you
about what Sara did,

685

about your Dad, and I know
there's a part of you

686

that's never gonna forgive me.

687

Being in charge of this place,

688

it comes with
a whole mess of decisions

689

you never really want to make.

690

But people live and die here

691

based on your ability
to make those decisions.

692

What are you...
What are you doing?

693

So, it's getting worse.
Parkinson's.

694

Yesterday my leg froze.
I almost...

695

couldn't stand.

696

Jesus, I...

697

Look, I'm not
saying it's today, okay?

698

Or tomorrow or a month from now,

699

but I got a clock ticking on me.

700

Yesterday, that clock started
ticking a little faster.

701

So... I need to know
that, when I'm gone...

702

- No, I'm not...
- Look!

703

I need to know
that when I'm gone

704

or when I'm too goddamn
feeble to do anything,

705

I need to know that
you are gonna step up

706

and look after this place.

707

It has to be you
wearing this badge

708

and not some hothead like Acosta

709

or anybody else
who might come through here.

710

You.

711

I need to know that
my family is in good hands.

712

I'm not taking your badge.

713

Kenny...

714

But...

715

if you're still
looking for a deputy,

716

I'll take that one back.

717

Okay?

718

Yeah?

719

Yeah. Come on.

720

Let's keep looking.

721

Fatima!

722

Okay. Here we go.

723

Ahh.

724

725

What the fuck do you want?
Huh?

726

You think at this point,

727

I haven't seen
enough of you people?

728

Try something new
'cause this... this,

729

it's not
doing it for me anymore.

You okay?
Who are you talking to?

733

Nobody.

Well... Well,
let me rephrase that:

735

who did you think
you were talking to?

736

Henry, I'm busy.
All right? What do you want?

737

You did this?

738

I did, yeah.

739

My wife made one
of these in our yard.

740

So you keep telling me.

741

What's it for?

742

I don't know, okay?
I thought it might help.

743

Help figure out
those numbers, you mean?

744

Is there something
I can help you with?

745

Most of the town's
out looking for that girl.

746

What?

747

Uh, the sheriff's
daughter-in-law.

748

We had a whole meeting about it.

749

Didn't you hear the bell?

750

Yeah, I just, I'm...

751

You were... you were busy.

752

Right, yeah.

794

Grandma said not to worry,
but I was so scared.

795

Turns out he's on a playground
on the other side of town,

796

having the time of his life.
Everyone was scared for nothing.

Is that what you think this is?

Everybody's scared for nothing?

All right, no offense.

We're not looking for some
fucking kid on a playground.

All right,
I already lost my mom.

happens to Fatima...

Your mom was here?

808

Look, when she died...

809

the way she died...

810

I can't go through that again.

811

I won't.

Best to check everywhere.

Besides, I think this'll
be a good place to talk.

Come on inside.

What happened to the window?

818

Well, we had a bit of
a close call not too long ago.

819

Doesn't look like
Fatima's in here.

820

I know.

821

Last time you were in here,
you were in pretty bad shape.

822

And all I remember
thinking was, "It's my fault."

823

"I was the one
who was driving."

824

"I was the one who didn't
see the other car coming."

825

I just kept thinking
we were gonna lose you,

826

right then and there,
just like we lost Thomas.

827

And I never would
have forgiven myself.

828

But it wasn't your fault.

829

No? Why not?

830

Well, because you were scared

831

and you were doing
the best you could.

832

Kinda like you were

833

when you told Julie
to go into those ruins?

834

You were doing
the best you could, right?

835

I guess.

Listen to me.

Things happen here,
things we can't control.

to blame ourselves.

You have to remember that
we're all doing our best,

841

even when bad things happen,

842

especially when
bad things happen.

843

Because how we face those
things, that's what matters.

844

Not the decisions we make

845

or whose fault it was, but how
we take care of each other

846

and how we always do our best,
no matter what.

gonna be from now on?

868

made it seem like this place

871

might actually be okay.

872

Oh, honey, we're gonna find her.

873

Don't worry. Come on.

874

I don't think I was dreaming.

875

What?

876

When I... when I blacked out
in the ruins, I...

877

it was almost like
I went somewhere.

878

Like, one second
I'm in this weird chamber

879

and the three of us are there...
me, Randall, and Marielle,

880

and we were screaming.

881

And then, there was
this guy chained to a wall,

882

and then I'm in these tunnels,

883

and I heard you
talking to Victor.

884

I tried to find you,
but your voice,

885

it kept just getting
further and further away.

886

And then I heard those children.

887

They were screaming that word.

888

Anghkooey.

889

All I kept thinking was,

890

"What if I never make it back?"

891

"What if... What if I'm lost
and no one ever finds me?"

892

No.

893

- "What if I'm alone now?"
- No.

894

I was just so scared.

895

Honey.

896

You're not alone.

897

You'll never,
never be alone here.

898

Okay? Come here.

899

What is it?

900

It's one of them watching us.

901

The children?

902

Yeah.

903

What is it doing?

904

She wants us to follow her.

905

Follow her where?

906

I don't know.
Come on.

907

Everything about
who Victor is now,

908

what he's been through,

909

I feel like I'm starting over
with a whole different person.

910

Well, yeah, it's 'cause you are.

911

Look, why are you
talking to me about this?

912

Why not Tabitha or...

913

I don't know,
literally anybody else.

914

Tabitha's got her own
kids to worry about.

915

And don't take this
the wrong way,

916

but you remind me of him.

917

I remind you of Victor?

918

A little. He's off,

919

trying to make
a block of wood tell a story,

920

and you're up on a ladder,

921

screaming at people
who aren't there.

922

Okay, that's fair.

923

How would it be for you

924

if your dad showed up here
and saw you like this?

925

What... what would you
want him to say to you?

926

Well, for starters,
I'd want to know

927

where the fuck he's been
my whole life,

928

but that's, uh,
that's... Listen, I...

929

You're trying to figure out
how to fix him, right?

930

You can't

931

'cause he's not broken.

932

Victor is the product
of what this place made him.

933

Victor has been surviving
here for decades.

934

He's been shaped
by this place. He's...

935

He's Tarzan,
growing up in the jungle.

936

And you're
the guy who comes along

937

and makes him
feel like an asshole

938

'cause he doesn't
know how to use a fork.

939

It's not rocket science.

940

Where are you going?

941

Back to the bar.

942

At least there I can pretend
I'm being productive.

943

Fatima!

944

[crows cawing in the distance]

945

Fatima!

946

You know she brought me here?

947

She was my proxy.

948

She helped me out a lot
since I first got here.

949

She's helped a lot of people.

950

It's what she does.

951

I'm so sorry about
what happened to your mom.

952

Forget about it.

953

You're not going to lose Fatima.

954

It's not gonna come to that.

955

She's gonna be okay.

956

Okay, would you just...

957

Just stop.

958

Please.

959

Just stop.

960

All right,
I appreciate you being out here.

961

I just can't...

962

I have to tell you something.

963

What?

964

When we were on the bus
on our way here, I had a dream.

965

Yeah, I remember.

966

And ever since then,

967

I feel like something
has been trying to talk to me.

968

What do you mean?

969

What if all this...

970

What if all of this
is happening for a reason?

971

What if Fatima
is out there right now,

972

doing something to help us?
