[Mark] <i>Devon! Devon!</i>

2

[Helly] <i>No, no, no. Listen,
we're not happy. We're miserable.</i>

3

- [knocks on window]
- [Irving, muffled] <i>Burt!</i>

4

[Helly] <i>They torture us down there!</i>

5

[Mark] <i>Devon!</i>

6

- [Helly] <i>We're prisoners!</i>
- [Irving] <i>Burt!</i>

7

[Mark] <i>She's alive!</i>

8

- [gasps, pants]
- [elevator bell dings]

9

I suppose you're Mark S.

10

- I...
- I'm Mark W.

11

Who are you people?

12

[speaking Italian]

13

Would you be open to
using a different first name

14

to avoid confusion?

15

Welcome back, Mark S.

16

Been a minute.

17

[Mark] Where are they?

18

[Mr. Milchick] I think it's best
to save any queries

19

till we arrive at the management office.

20

[Mark] Were they fired?

21

[Mr. Milchick] You can leave the balloons
in the foyer by my old desk.

22

We've much to discuss,
and I don't want them distracting you.

23

I assure you, they won't be taken.

24

Mr. Milchick, please.

25

What you all did five months ago

26

was one of the most painful moments
in the history of this company.

27

Five months?

28

I, too, was wounded by it.

29

But we must be cut to heal, mustn't we?

30

Wait, did you say your old office?

31

Mark, this is Miss Huang.

32

Miss Huang, Mark S.

33

Hello.

34

She'll be happy to mind your balloons
while we chat.

35

Right this way, Mark.

36

You can shut it.

37

Is it normal for a child to...

38

Excuse the clutter.

39

Okay. What's happening?

40

Ms. Cobel is no longer with this company.

41

I now manage the severed floor.

42

What about my team?

43

We didn't fire them.

44

Helly R. and Irving B. both successfully
made contact with persons on the outside,

45

just as you did.

46

Dylan G.'s outie learned what happened
after the fact.

47

The four of you
have achieved international fame.

48

As a group, you've become known
as the face of severance reform.

49

- Severance ref...
- Have a seat, Mark.

50

Shortly before your mutiny,
we installed security doors

51

to keep you in MDR.

52

This accompanied a punitive rendition
of the Kier hymn performed by Ms. Cobel.

53

Do you recall?

54

I do.

55

I locked you in a room
like an animal, Mark.

56

As an unsevered man,

57

I'll carry that knowledge
the rest of my life.

58

But for the past five months,

59

we've been asking how a sadist
like Harmony Cobel

60

could take fertile root in Lumon soil.

61

And what that says about us.

62

We also know Ms. Cobel
was at your sister's home

63

when you awoke there.

64

Yeah. W-Why was that?

65

We believe she'd developed
an erotic fixation on you

66

and had plans to pursue both you
and your outie

67

in what might be termed "a throuple."

68

What?

69

Thankfully, she failed at this.

70

You still haven't told me
where my team is.

71

We tried for weeks to get them back, Mark.

72

None of them agreed.

73

We told them of the reforms,
but it wasn't enough.

74

Except for me?

75

Your outie insisted on returning.

76

In fact, he begged us to let him back
right away.

77

So the others, they... they refused?

78

Yes.

79

Well, I'd like to hear it from them.

80

That's not possible.

81

Enjoy your balloons.

82

[Mark W.] Yeah. We... We showed up
about an hour before you did.

83

It's a little cramped
compared to our old MDR,

84

but I love the green carpet.

85

Ours was a crème brûlée
and the keyboards were puce.

86

[employee] They were purple.

87

No. They were puce.
I know because it makes me nauseous,

88

and I hate sweets.

89

Speaking of which, how much do we see
of that Mr. "Milkshake"?

90

Milchick.

91

[Mark W.] What?

92

Uh, it's Milchick, not milkshake.
And I don't know.

93

Marco,
where I can find some ink, uh, pencils?

94

Uh, supply closet.

95

[speaking Italian]

96

I'll show ya.

97

- So, did you really see the outie world?
- Yeah.

98

[chuckles] How's the sky?

99

I don't know.

100

- What, you didn't see it? [chuckles]
- Well, I went outside for a second,

101

but I was distracted by my brother-in-law.

102

Seriously?

103

Because we made a list of
what we'd most like to see on the outside.

104

And, uh, sky was an easy number one.
[chuckles]

105

Brothers-in-law weren't even on the list.

106

<i>Grazie.</i>

107

Could you tell what state we were in?

108

Because three of us put Wyoming
on our input survey.

109

- Did you see any buttes?
- No.

110

Oh, my God. How's wind?

111

Is it just like getting breathed on,
kind of?

112

Hello, Refiners.

113

Hello, Miss Huang.

114

[Mark W.] Oh, no. It's the ball game.

115

Let's head to the kitchenette.

116

Okay. So,

117

my name is Miss Huang.

118

It's my first day here as deputy manager.

119

I guess something about me is that
before this, I was a crossing guard.

120

[chuckles]

121

Mark W.?

122

Why are you a child?

123

Because of when I was born.

124

Right. I'm Mark W.

125

I'm from the MDR department of branch 5X,

126

where I worked with Gwendolyn Y.

127

Kind of a fun fact about me is that
I thought I'd be permanently retired

128

when my branch shut down.

129

So this is a nice surprise.

130

Mark S.?

131

[clicks tongue] Okay.

132

[clicks tongue]

133

I'm Mark S.

134

And, uh, I've been here about two years.

135

Something about me...

136

is...

137

that I am lucky enough
to have made four new friends today.

138

- [laughs]
- That's nice, Mark.

139

But I have to remind you
that I'm a supervisor,

140

not a friend.

141

Three new friends.

142

Okay.

143

Congratulations to our
two Marks. And now...

144

[sighs]

145

[sniffs]

146

[beeps]

147

[elevator bell dings]

148

[elevator bell dings]

149

[elevator bell dings]

150

What's your perpetuity wing like?

151

- Do the Eagans move?
- Uh, no.

152

Huh.
Probably because it's an older branch.

153

- Ours were animatronic.
- Oh.

154

They even did
this little choreographed dance.

155

So yours just stand there? That's weird.

156

[Italian employee] In my first
perpetuity wing, the Eagans were brooms.

157

[Gwendolyn] Brooms?

158

- Each with a face made of a plate.
- A plate?

159

We were very poor.

160

[Gwendolyn] Did you guys
have the CPR dummies?

161

- [Italian employee] Yeah.
- Hmm. What were those made of?

162

- Brooms.
- [Mark W.] Did you have an elevator?

163

[Italian employee] We had...
How do you say, um, a rope.

164

[Gwendolyn] Jesus.

165

I'm heading out. You good?

166

Yep. Just about to close out.

167

Ah, good. Thank you.

168

You know, my old team
was a bunch of dirtbags.

169

We never hit quota. Not once.

170

But it seems like you really liked yours.

171

So, I'm sorry.

172

Good night, Mark.

173

Good night.

174

- [scanner beeps]
- [elevator bell dings]

175

Hey, everybody.

176

[Mr. Milchick] "Dear Outie,

177

I don't know if this will reach you,
but I'm writing to alert you

178

of the heinous conditions
in the severed office

179

to which you have transferred me.

180

The branch is run by a shambolic rube
who goes by Milkshake."

181

Oh, my God.

182

"A man whose stupidity is rivaled
only by that of the nine core principles.

183

If you must continue to send me here,
please consider strapping a bomb to me,

184

so that I may explode both Milkshake
and the very spirit of Kier Eagan.

185

Wrathfully, your innie, Mark W."

186

Oh, my God. That's... [stammers]
very serious.

187

Is it earnest?

188

Mm-mmm.

189

Do you really think I'm a shambolic rube?

190

Wait, you think I wrote this note?

191

[speaking Italian]

192

Were you going to frame all of us
or just Mark W.?

193

Clever way to secure the name
for yourself, I suppose?

194

- I don't know why you hate this team.
- [Mark] I don't hate this team.

195

You didn't even
disguise your own handwriting.

196

You know what?
I don't even know who this team is.

197

I told you. I want my team.

198

Which part of that don't you understand?

199

[inhales deeply]

200

Mark S., at this time,
I revoke your status as Department Chief,

201

which will be transferred
to your intended victim, Mark W.

202

I accept.

203

You will be relegated to the office

204

and must check in regularly
as to your progress.

205

Do you even have a brother-in-law, asshole?

206

What's funny?

207

[chuckles]

208

You don't know what I did
to the kitchenette yet, do you?

209

[laughing]

210

Goddamn it.

211

Hey!

212

You're definitely not supposed to do that.

213

Mr. Milchick,
I've got Mark S. in your office.

214

He's got the speaker.

215

Hello? Is anyone there? Is the Board on?
It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement.

216

[static feedback]

217

Okay. Well... [stammers]
if you're there, please listen.

218

Now, I know that you want to
do the right thing for severed people,

219

- which is why I need to see my team again.
- [Mr. Milchick] Mark!

220

If we truly are the face
of severance reform, as you say,

221

- then they deserve a chance.
- [Mr. Milchick] Mark!

222

[Mark] Please. They're my friends!

223

You can't just make them disappear!
Please!

224

[breathing heavily]

225

[Mark] Um, look, Mr. Milchick, I only
went to the Board because I cannot...

226

[Mr. Milchick] The Board
does not converse with innies.

227

It is clear your outie's fame
has gone to your innie's head.

228

No, my innie just wants his coworkers back
so we can serve Kier together.

229

- [beeps]
- [elevator bell dings]

230

Are you firing me?

231

On you go.

232

Why can't you just bring them back?

233

Goodbye, Mark S.

234

Wait!

235

[elevator bell dings]

236

[elevator bell dings]

237

[whimpering, panting]

238

[elevator doors open]

239

- [elevator bell dings]
- [doors open]

240

- Dylan!
- Mark.

241

- Did it work?
- It worked.

242

- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

243

Milchick was... I didn't think
I was coming back.

244

- I've been back a couple days already.
- What?

245

Yeah. And they had a whole new team.

246

- Cobel just replaced us?
- No, no, no, no.

247

Cobel's gone. Milchick's in charge.

248

Okay, so the man who just tackled me
and cut up my best belt is our boss now?

249

- Fuck me.
- Wait, wait. He tackled you?

250

Yeah, bad. Which... I mean, fair,
I tackled the man first,

251

but I didn't fuck with his belt.

252

"Kier pardons his betrayers"?

253

- [knocking]
- [Irving] Burt! Burt!

254

[Dylan] Dude, are you okay?

255

Irving, what happened?

256

The fuck? Irv! Dude, what's wrong?
You poor up there?

257

Come on. Come on.

258

[sighs]

259

[elevator bell dings]

260

[panting]

261

[Mark] Helly!

262

Oh, my God. Are you okay?

263

I'm okay. [pants] Did you wake up?

264

- Yeah, yeah, it was crazy.
- Same.

265

Oh, my God. I was so worried about you.
[sniffles]

266

- How long has it been?
- [sighs] Five months, maybe more.

267

Where's everybody else?

268

Come on.

269

They're gone.

270

[Irving groans]

271

[Helly] Irving?

272

He won't come out.

273

[Irving groans]

274

- Hey, Irv?
- [Irving] I'm... I'm sorry, Mark.

275

I just need a moment, please.

276

[Mark] Okay. Take your time.

277

Okay, so what is going on?
We're not in trouble?

278

I don't think so. I mean,
Milchick said our message got out.

279

He said we're famous.

280

All of us equally
or one of us is, like, the star?

281

I don't know.
But then he tried to fire me, I think.

282

Why?

283

[stammers] Well, because I sort of
sabotaged the new people.

284

- New people?
- So, what the fuck happened up there?

285

Well, look, Milchick is probably coming.

286

Good. I owe him a fucking belt cut.
Now tell me.

287

What if they're waiting for us
to tell each other what happened

288

because they don't know what happened?

289

I mean, what if they're listening, Dylan?

290

Wait, what happened
to the security camera?

291

- [door unlocks]
- [Irving grunts, sniffs]

292

I...

293

I'm sorry, I was, uh...

294

just, uh...

295

Are you okay?

296

Hi, everyone. I'm Miss Huang.

297

Mr. Milchick's waiting for you
in the break room.

298

[Dylan] What the fuck is going on?
Why is she, like, eight?

299

[Mark] I don't know.

300

Wait, s-so they replaced us?

301

Uh, for a couple days.

302

Who was me?

303

They weren't, like, specific counterparts.

304

They were, I don't know, weird.

305

Okay. Well,
I don't think you should feel bad at all.

306

- Feel bad?
- Yeah, for ending their lives. Fuck 'em.

307

Well, I wasn't trying to...

308

[Dylan] No, dude,
I'm saying don't feel bad.

309

Like, I'm sure they deserved it.

310

[door beeps]

311

[door closes]

312

Macrodata Refinement. Welcome back.

313

Please, take a seat.

314

Irving, if you wouldn't mind
being in back.

315

Tall glass of water.

316

I guess the Board reconsidered my terms.

317

Guess so.

318

What you're about to see will be shown
to every innie who sets foot

319

in this building after today.

320

I hope it will give you
a sense of Lumon's feelings.

321

[whimsical music playing]

322

[bird screeches]

323

<i>Oh, hi. You probably don't recognize me
from this angle.</i>

324

<i>I'm the Lumon Administrative Building,
branch 501.</i>

325

<i>And you're sitting in me right now.</i>

326

<i>The name's a mouthful,
or as I say, a "doorful."</i>

327

<i>So you can just call me Lumon.</i>

328

<i>I've gone through a lot of changes
since my siring here in 1870.</i>

329

<i>But one thing I've always had
is a love for my workers,</i>

330

<i>both unsevered and severed.</i>

331

<i>Not to brag,</i>

332

<i>but my basement floor is one
of the premier severed workspaces</i>

333

<i>in the 206 countries
from which Lumon operates.</i>

334

<i>Hey, no running in my halls!</i>

335

<i>That tickles.</i>

336

[gulps]

337

[chuckles]

338

<i>But what makes a building truly happy?</i>

339

<i>This question came to light
when four MDR workers,</i>

340

<i>dissatisfied with their severed lives,</i>

341

<i>conspired to mount
what Lumon historians will forever call</i>

342

<i>the Macrodat Uprising.</i>

343

<i>Under my literal nose unfolded
a human drama of danger and intrigue.</i>

344

<i>Righteous anger.</i>

345

<i>Let's burn this place to the ground.</i>

346

[Lumon Administrative Building]
<i>Inspiration.</i>

347

<i>Why are we down here
still working in the dark?</i>

348

[Lumon Administrative Building] <i>And love.</i>

349

What the shit?

350

<i>The Macrodat Uprising
yielded bounteous reforms.</i>

351

<i>These include tasty new snacks,
like fruit leather, cut beans,</i>

352

<i>Christmas mints, and salsa.</i>

353

[mouthing] Ah... Wh...

354

<i>Not sold yet?</i>

355

<i>The incentives were also reformed</i>

356

<i>and now range from hall passes
to pineapple bobbing...</i>

357

<i>to our brand-new playful mirror room.</i>

358

<i>You know, it's funny. I've sat by
this reflective pool my whole life,</i>

359

<i>yet it took the quiet courage of four
MDR heroes to show me who I really am.</i>

360

<i>They made quite a splash.</i>

361

<i>They sure did, Water Tower.
And I thank Kier for them.</i>

362

<i>I thank Kier for the Macrodat Uprising.</i>

363

I know we have our differences...

364

but I want you to know that
I truly respect each and every one of you.

365

And I don't wanna be your jailer.

366

By end of day, each of you will choose
whether you want to remain here.

367

Not your outies, but you.

368

If you start work on your file,
I'll assume you want to stay.

369

If not, I'll send you to the surface.
No ill will.

370

Maybe I'll even buy you
a drink at a bistro one day. [chuckles]

371

Like the rest of the severed floor,

372

the break room has no cameras
or microphones.

373

Privacy shouldn't mean packing
into a supply closet

374

like so many sardines. [chuckles]

375

I truly hope you all will choose to stay
and enjoy what you've helped build.

376

A new quarter. A fresh start.

377

For all of us.

378

[door closes]

379

What the hell was that?

380

Massive-ass head game is what that was.

381

So what the hell
did you guys see up there?

382

Well...

383

He said there were no microphones in here.

384

Yeah, he says a lot of shit,
so just fucking whisper it.

385

Okay.

386

[whispering] So, I was at a party
at my sister's house for Ricken Hale.

387

Wait, what?

388

You know Ricken Hale?

389

[Mark] He's my outie's brother-in-law.

390

What?

391

And for some reason, we both know Cobel.

392

[Dylan] That's insane.

393

Yeah. Well, there's something else.

394

Just before I switched back,
I found a wedding photo.

395

Now, I guess my outie's wife died
a few years ago.

396

Oh, shit.

397

Which, apparently, is part of
why I decided to get severed.

398

Except...

399

[chuckles]

400

the woman in the photo was Ms. Casey.

401

Ms. Casey is your wife?

402

Is my outie's wife.

403

But she's dead.

404

No, I know, but it was her.

405

Then she's down here.

406

No. I went to Wellness. It's gone.

407

What do you mean, gone?

408

I mean, it's gone.

409

Oh, my God. Mark, are you okay?

410

Yeah. Well, I don't know.

411

[stammers] What about you?
What did you see?

412

I saw the inside

413

of a really fucking boring apartment.

414

[Mark] So, you live by yourself?

415

Yeah.

416

I was watching some nature show on TV,
wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt.

417

[Dylan] What kind of T-shirt?
Did it feature, like, a band or pocket?

418

It was like a "save the gorillas" shirt.

419

Cool.

420

I guess.

421

And then what?

422

Uh, then I went outside and found a guy.
He... He looked like a gardener.

423

Told him everything. I think
he kind of thought it was bullshit.

424

But, uh, he said that
his brother was a cop

425

and that he would tell him everything.

426

I don't know.
Sorry, guys. I... I... I really tried.

427

A gardener?

428

Yeah.

429

A night gardener?

430

I... I think so. I mean, maybe
he has a different job during the day.

431

Oh.

432

What about you, Irv?

433

Do you s... suppose he's serious?

434

About letting us leave?

435

Irv, what did you see?

436

It's not our world up there.

437

That's what I saw.

438

Come on, man.

439

You can tell us.

440

[Helly] Yeah, it's okay.

441

Even if it's bad.

442

Irv.

443

I just wanna walk for a bit.

444

- I'll talk to him.
- No, no. We should all go.

445

No. He's fine, okay?

446

Let me talk him down. You go back to camp.
I'll get you if I need you.

447

- Are you sure? You...
- [Helly] But...

448

Hey, Irv's gonna be okay, right?

449

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

450

Dylan's on it.

451

And we have till the end of the day.

452

Yeah.

453

Did you guys look happy
in the wedding photo?

454

Yeah, we did.

455

You know, I never, like...
Ms. Casey and I never felt that way.

456

Okay.

457

So, what are you gonna do?

458

Well, uh...

459

I gotta get her out of here.

460

Right? I mean,
if she's my wife... [stammers]

461

Right. Of course.
I mean, assuming she's still here.

462

Though technically, strictly speaking,
she's not your wife.

463

I'm pretty sure
your outie bought the ring.

464

Sure.

465

Except, you know,
we're the same-ish person.

466

So, it's, uh, mushy.

467

[scoffs] It's m... It's mushy?

468

- Is that what it is? Mushy? Okay.
- It's... Yeah. Listen, Helly...

469

We're not the same, actually.

470

Us and the outies, we're not.

471

And speaking for myself,
I don't think we owe them shit.

472

But Ms. Casey is...

473

Well, she's one of us.

474

So, if you wanna help your outie
and find out what happened to her...

475

I'll help.

476

So you're staying?

477

I think I'm staying.

478

- Irv. Hold up.
- Leave me alone, Dylan.

479

Oka... Dude. Is it...
You can't leave until the end of the day.

480

Are you sure?

481

Irv.

482

I failed at the objective.

483

What?

484

I went to go find Burt.

485

Okay. Did you see him?

486

He's married,
or, at least, he's with someone.

487

I... I saw them through the window.

488

Shit.

489

I should be happy he's happy.

490

Yeah. But, um,
seems like you're probably not, right?

491

The last time I was happy
was when all I knew was MDR.

492

When I was good at my job

493

and not trying to be happy.

494

I'm going to leave, Dylan.

495

It is not leaving.
So stop fucking calling it that.

496

- I know, you want... I know...
- Just fucking try.

497

You're a good friend, Dylan.

498

[breathing deeply]

499

Before I went to Burt's,
I woke up in my apartment.

500

What?

501

I was standing in front of
some kind of easel.

502

Fuck. There's easels up there?

503

Yeah. My outie was working on
a painting of a hallway. A black hallway.

504

Like the break room one?

505

[Irving] No, it was different. Darker.

506

There was an elevator at the end
with a downward arrow.

507

He painted dozens of them.

508

Fuck. Why?

509

I don't know.
And I wanted you to know before I left.

510

- Okay. Well, you're not. You... No.
- [straining]

511

Stop it. Stop it. Listen to me.

512

Look, I'm sorry that outie Burt
has a hot husband or whatever.

513

But he is not the point.
Innie Burt is the guy you fell for,

514

and I know
because I encouraged the courtship.

515

I...

516

I want it to be over.

517

Okay. So then after you find
the black hallway or... [stammers]

518

I want the pain to be over.

519

If he's gone and I'm gone...

520

Stop saying that.

521

Then somehow, we'll be together.

522

He wouldn't want that.

523

How do you know?

524

Because I don't want that.

525

Because I would be sad,

526

and I would be less productive,

527

and I'm really good at what I do here,
whatever it is.

528

And you're part of what makes me
good at it. So please, do not go.

529

Dylan.

530

I'm your favorite perk.

531

Don't bring them into this.

532

All I'm saying is, if Burt was still here,

533

he would be telling you to stick around
and figure out what the fuck this is.

534

[Miss Huang] Dylan G.

535

Mr. Milchick would like to see you.

536

Right.

537

I know, but they said it would be
corrected by now.

538

It should be Mr. Milchick.

539

M-R-period-space-M-I-L-C-H-I-C-K.

540

- Well, I sympathize...
- Mr. Milchick...

541

but could you please see
that it's taken care of? Yes. Thank you.

542

If someone calls about my welcome screen,

543

I need you to put
that call through immediately.

544

Yes, sir.

545

You wanted to see me?

546

I did.

547

Thank you, Miss Huang.

548

You gonna apologize about the belt?

549

Your wife's name is Gretchen.

550

What?

551

She wanted you to know.

552

Come with me.

553

And I do apologize, Dylan,
for not being a better listener.

554

For not hearing your needs.

555

[chuckles] Take a look.

556

These are blueprints for a new renovation,

557

of which I chose
not to inform your colleagues.

558

It's called
the Outie Family Visitation Suite.

559

[chuckles] Are you saying
I could see my family here?

560

If you take the name of the room
at face value, I'd say yes.

561

Holy fuck.

562

[chuckles] The holiest.

563

Sadly, everyone else
in your department is single.

564

As such, I'm asking that you
keep this between us...

565

- Are... Are you...
- only to avoid resentment.

566

I'd hate for your friends to turn against
you after all you've done for them.

567

You okay?

568

[Dylan] I'm okay.

569

Where's Irv?

570

[Irving] Right here.

571

Irv. You okay?

572

I'm okay.

573
