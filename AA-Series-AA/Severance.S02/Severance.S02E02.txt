<i>Devon!</i>

2

<i>No.
Listen, we're not happy, we're miserable.</i>

3

Burt!

4

- They torture us down there!
- <i>Devon!</i>

5

<i>We're prisoners!</i>

6

<i>Burt!</i>

7

She's alive!

8

- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

9

Mark?
Here. Will you take her for a second?

10

- It's okay. I got her. Yeah.
- Be careful with her.

11

- Don't go far though.
- I won't.

12

Mark.

13

So, this is you now?

14

Yeah.

15

Are you okay?

16

Yeah.

17

- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18

What's my name?

19

Persephone.

20

Can you spell that?

21

- Never.
- Okay.

22

Babe...

23

- Okay.
- ...need help with this diaper.

24

Oh, boy.

25

I think she wants mommy.

26

Fetid moppet.

27

Father.

28

We'll have someone
from the floor liaise with the outies.

29

We need to find out
who they talked to. Promptly.

30

<i>I need you to go see all of them.</i>

31

Find out every word they said
and who they said it to.

32

And shall I fire them?

33

Let Kier guide your hand.

34

Of course.

35

Please, sit.

36

We've commandeered the footage
taken by guests.

37

Natalie is already
doing outreach to media.

38

And the severed employees
who were involved are being dealt with.

39

Thank you for acting so quickly.

40

You saved us from disaster.

41

Will Mr. Eagan be joining?

42

Just me.

43

I personally owe you a debt of gratitude.

44

It cost me dearly.

45

It did.

46

And still,
you proved your loyalty tonight.

47

Which is why we'd like to ask you back.

48

An apology is warranted.

49

I apologize.

50

My father apologizes.

51

The Board apologizes.

52

We've treated you poorly.

53

I'm sorry.

54

I welcome your contrition.

55

I'm so glad.

56

There's much damage to control.

57

I recommend we start by scouring the feed,

58

and I need to interview Dylan G.
to see how he gained access to the--

59

We have something else in mind.

60

We'd like to offer you a promotion.

61

Severance Advisory Council.

62

I never heard of such a thing.

63

It's a brand-new initiative.
You'd be spearheading its formation.

64

Your expertise is greatly valued.

65

Which is why
I should be running the severed floor.

66

Mr. Milchick
has been promoted to floor manager.

67

You don't value me.

68

You fear me.

69

We fear no one.

70

<i>And if we didn't hold you
in such high esteem,</i>

71

we wouldn't be making this generous offer.

72

I'll put some thought to it.

73

Thank you for coming in, Harmony.
Mr. Drummond will see you out.

74

<i>I don't need an escort.</i>

75

Ready?

76

<i>Earlier this evening,</i>

77

<i>at an event where I was excited
to share my status as a severed individual</i>

78

<i>with a group of friends and allies,</i>

79

<i>I made the poor decision
to consume alcohol</i>

80

<i>while on a non-Lumon medication
for an arm rash.</i>

81

<i>This had an inebriating effect,</i>

82

<i>which caused me
to say some deeply regrettable things.</i>

83

- Mr. Milchick.
- Apologies for the hour.

84

Is everything all right?

85

How's your night been, Mr. Bailiff?

86

Fine. They're showing
<i>Barber of Seville</i> on TV.

87

So I've just been here.

88

Wonderful. And you're feeling well?

89

Oh, God. What did I eat in there?

90

We just need to know
if anything of note occurred.

91

Anything at all.

92

Why don't you tell me
what's going on, Mr. Milchick?

93

<i>In the moment,
I thought I was being funny.</i>

94

But in the hours since this outburst,

95

I've been reminded
just how seriously my family's company

96

affects the lives of real people
around the world.

97

You know, your innie is a friend of mine.

98

I feel confident
he'd approve of me saying so.

99

And he's a man of principle,
which is rare.

100

Which is what makes this so difficult.

101

You're firing me?

102

When Lumon falters,

103

it's our cherished workers
and their families who suffer first.

104

<i>So for the fear and insecurity
this has caused, I must sincerely atone.</i>

105

You were involved
in a physical altercation

106

with another employee this evening.

107

It was brief but violent.

108

And I regret to say
that you were the aggressor.

109

- Wait--
- As such,

110

I'm afraid we've no choice
but to terminate your employment,

111

effective immediately.

112

Distrust of Lumon
has been sadly endemic since its founding.

113

My words provided more fuel
for a pernicious hate and derision.

114

You can't just do that. What happened?

115

Did I break something?
Or I can pay. I have cash upstairs.

116

When I said my innie was being tortured...

117

What am I supposed to tell my wife?

118

This was a joke and a lie.

119

I'm sorry.

120

I'm committed to this company
with every part of me.

121

<i>But I'm also human.</i>

122

Just like my innie...

123

<i>and just like you.</i>

124

Well, that was more drama than I planned.

125

I guess so.

126

I'll let you know if we do
another reading.

127

Yes, please do.

128

And don't punish the baby, Ricken.
This wasn't its fault.

129

Of course. Good night, Rebeck.

130

I'm not the only one who heard you say it.

131

- It's not like I made this up.
- Right. You know, I'm just--

132

We can reschedule
the reading to next month. It's fine.

133

I just have to decide
if I'm going to restart

134

- with chapter 1.
- So what?

135

So you said, "She's alive."

136

- If I may--
- I'm trying to help you.

137

If I may, I really did feel it was clear
you were referencing the baby.

138

- Patton had just saved her.
- Well, he found her, yeah.

139

And I think that your workie was excited.

140

I have to say, Mark, he really is a jewel.

141

Guys,
obviously I was referencing the baby.

142

Yeah.

143

- Okay?
- Yes.

144

No. Yeah. I agre... I think Ricken is right.

145

I agree.

146

I... Babe, will you take her for a second?

147

Yep.

148

So let's Occam's razor this shit.

149

You're looking for Eleanor,

150

you find this picture,
which obviously is of interest to you,

151

- so you pick it up.
- Right.

152

And then when Patton found Eleanor--

153

- Saved her, I'd still say.
- Okay, whatever, yes.

154

- You still had it with you.
- Yeah.

155

Yeah. I think it's the only thing
that makes sense.

156

Okay. And Eleanor
was in the study because...

157

Because Mrs. Selvig left her in there.

158

- Or Cobel, whatever the fuck.
- Right.

159

Perhaps "Cobelvig"
would be a helpful nomenclature.

160

And assuming that "She's alive"
really was about the baby--

161

I mean, you don't think it was?

162

- I do think it was.
- Then why are you saying it like that?

163

I don't... Sorry, I'm just exhausted.

164

- It's been a weird fucking night, Mark.
- Oh, my God.

165

Why are you getting aggressive

166

- with me right now?
- Oh, my God! Th--

167

- Okay, guys. Okay.
- Whatever.

168

Let's deal with what we know to be true,
all right?

169

Mark's workie went to great lengths
to awaken himself to alert us to abuses.

170

He was inspired by my book.

171

He found great meaning in it. Profundity.

172

Goddamn it, Rebeck.

173

- Honey, can-- Got her?
- Yeah.

174

What the fuck are you even saying?

175

Why are you being a dick to me?
I'm trying to help you.

176

- I'm just trying to get--
- Good evening, Dr. Hale.

177

- Good evening.
- Seth Milchick from Lumon.

178

Is Mark Scout here by chance?

179

Yes, he is.

180

Come in.

181

Thank you.

182

Mr. Scout.

183

I imagine you have a few questions.

184

You could say that.

185

May I sit with you?

186

Right this way.

187

You must be Devon.

188

Okay. So...

189

That is a magnificent helmet.

190

Thank you.

191

What happened tonight is what we call
the "overtime contingency."

192

It's a safeguard we employ

193

if we ever need to access
your work personage off company grounds.

194

Yeah, you never told me about this.

195

OTC disclosure can be found
in your start paperwork.

196

It seems the tech was commandeered
by one of your office mates,

197

allowing him to wake the rest of you
for a period of 39 minutes.

198

Innie Mark was here in this house.

199

I know. I talked to him.

200

What did he say to you?

201

If I tell you,
are you gonna punish him for it?

202

We have no punishments at Lumon.

203

Uh-huh.

204

We're more concerned
about how you're doing, Mr. Scout.

205

I can only imagine how violated
you feel by his actions.

206

- Yes, speaking of violations...
- You--

207

...just wondering how common it is

208

for your managers to commit
fucking lactation fraud

209

against their employees' families.

210

Pretty common?

211

Ms. Cobel.

212

Yeah.

213

What we learned tonight
is that she is quite severely unwell.

214

Yeah. She lives next door to me.

215

I, like, know her.

216

And her behavior at Lumon

217

seems to be the source
of your innie's distress.

218

She will never descend
to that floor again.

219

Nor bedevil you out here any further.

220

You have my word.

221

But we do need to know
what we're dealing with.

222

Is there anything?
Anything you can tell me?

223

I mean--

224

No, I mean, we're very tired.

225

Yes, we are.

226

I think
we've just said all there is to say.

227

Okay. Of course. I'll circle back.

228

In the meantime, I hope to see you Monday.

229

Yeah. I don't know, man.

230

What your innie did tonight
was completely unauthorized.

231

It was also very brave.

232

I'd hate to reward his courage
with nonexistence.

233

<i>You think we're about to meet our spouses?</i>

234

<i>Maybe.</i>

235

<i>Maybe it's each other.</i>

236

<i>That'd be a hoot.</i>

237

<i>Yeah, like,
mid-argument over car wash coupons.</i>

238

<i>"Honey, you're cutting them wrong!"</i>

239

- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

240

In case we don't come back.

241

<i>Or, I don't know, in case we do?</i>

242

<i>In case we don't come back.</i>

243

<i>Or, I don't know, in case we do?</i>

244

You got this.

245

No pressure. Be cool.

246

You are so awesome. Smile.

247

May I ask about benefits?

248

There's a coffee maker.

249

I meant health care benefits.

250

Sure. Yes, of course.
For you. Your family.

251

Okay, great. Yeah, you know,

252

I think this is gonna be
a really great fit for me, Mr. Saliba.

253

You know, ever since I was a kid,

254

- I've always felt like doors had--
- How old?

255

Sorry?

256

How old were you
when you knew you loved doors?

257

Five.

258

If you could be any kind of door,
what would it be?

259

Pocket.

260

- Interesting. Tell me more.
- Yes.

261

Well, you're, you know,
doing your door thing and then

262

when you're not needed, you can just--

263

Just tuck yourself away.

264

Flat finish or eggshell?

265

Semi-gloss.

266

That's hot.

267

You remind me of me, Dylan.

268

You like kickball?

269

As a skill? Or, like,
do I follow it professionally? I--

270

Yeah.

271

We play on Fridays.
There's a fun prize if you win.

272

You mean a door prize.

273

Sorry.

274

A lot of short-term employment.
And then Lumon.

275

- Yes.
- And they make their doors in-house.

276

It's fucking hubris.

277

Yeah.

278

I was a severed employee, so...

279

You're a severed?

280

Yes. Yeah, I was. But you know,

281

it's just me here and...

282

Well, Mr. George, thanks for coming in.

283

What?

284

We'll consider
your application thoroughly.

285

That's it? Just because I'm severed?

286

Like I said, we'll consider
your application thoroughly.

287

Okay. You're not considering me at all.
That's discrimination.

288

We need a certain kind of person here,
Mr. George,

289

not a certain kind of two people.

290

What do you think this is?
A carpet factory?

291

- What?
- You want to circumcise your brain,

292

that's your business.

293

But it doesn't mean I have to hire you.
And personally, I think it's abhorrent.

294

Read the room.

295

I would have picked up the phone
if it was good news.

296

<i>I'm sorry. You'll get the next one.</i>

297

Stop being nice.

298

Hey, do we need more baby wipeys?

299

<i>I don't think so.</i>

300

You know what? I'll get some anyway.
I'll be home soon.

301

<i>Okay. Bye, hon.</i>

302

<i>So, he's your boss?</i>

303

And what about "Cobelvig"?
Have you heard from her?

304

I went by there.
No one answered the door though.

305

Fuck. Well, I was just thinking,

306

maybe there was a way we could confirm
what your innie meant.

307

Devon. Jesus Christ. Are you serious?

308

I know we're not supposed to contact him

309

but Danise is a lawyer and apparently,

310

- you can petition--
- I'm quitting.

311

- You're quitting?
- Yeah.

312

Okay. Have you called them already?

313

No, I was gonna do it tonight.

314

Uh-huh.

315

I'm sorry.

316

Haven't you been trying to get me
to quit that place since I got there?

317

I thought
I was finally doing what you want.

318

No. Yes, but don't you think
that was strange last night?

319

I mean, why was he so curious?

320

Devon, what are you doing?
You remember I identified her, right?

321

- Yes, Mark.
- I saw her body.

322

Yeah, I know.

323

My thing is, if we could just get, like,
a half-step more confirmation,

324

then it's not gonna be something
that continues to haunt us.

325

- Do you know what I mean?
- Us?

326

Yes. She was my family too, Mark. Fuck.

327

Yeah. But she was my wife.

328

I know, but you're not the only one
her death affected.

329

- Oh, really? It affected you?
- Yes.

330

Did you have to tell her parents
that she was dead?

331

How about her students?

332

How about this.

333

Did your sheets smell like her
for weeks afterwards?

334

You know what? Honestly,
if Ricken died and his body burned,

335

- I'd be sad for you.
- Wow.

336

But I wouldn't be affected.

337

This is obscene.

338

I just want to be sure.

339

I am sure!

340

- I'll talk to you later.
- Mark.

341

Mark.

342

Okay.

343

You're not picking up. I get it.

344

I want you to know
my innie got the message.

345

Mr. Milchick?

346

Compliments of the company.

347

We got off on the wrong foot last night.

348

Okay to talk a minute?

349

Yeah. Come on in.

350

Thank you.

351

So, Mr. Scout, I know you're still
weighing whether to return to Lumon.

352

Yeah.

353

I'd like to ask you a few questions
that may inform your decision.

354

Is that all right?

355

Okay.

356

Terrific.

357

First, how happy are you
with your current financial compensation?

358

I ask because our endearment to you
is such that a 20% bump is on the table,

359

should you return.

360

20%. Wow.

361

My second question is whether a full
investigation into your innie's claims,

362

and regular wellness checks
from independent orgs,

363

would help you
feel more excited to return?

364

Well, I don't know.
Is that what they're doing?

365

It's the first step of many.

366

My third question
concerns your late wife, Gemma.

367

What about her?

368

In your intake interview,

369

you cited her death
as a primary motivator for severing.

370

Do you remember what you said?

371

No.

372

You said since she died,
every day feels like a year.

373

That you felt like
you were choking on her ghost.

374

Do you still feel that way, Mr. Scout?

375

The Mark I've come to know
at Lumon is happy.

376

He cares for people and he's funny.

377

He knows nothing of the pain
I see in you right now.

378

He's found love.

379

Love?

380

With who?

381

The solace you have given him down there
will make its way to you.

382

It just takes time.

383

I hope you'll give us that time,
Mr. Scout.

384

Are you satisfied with this?

385

The sister seems more uppity than he is.

386

So, who are you bringing into MDR?

387

I've got a floater from overseas
and a pair who were laid off from 5X.

388

5X?

389

Really?

390

<i>I had 48 hours to pull this together.</i>

391

<i>Hopefully there will be some chemistry.</i>

392

<i>We don't need chemistry.</i>

393

<i>We need Mark S. back to work.</i>

394

Go on ahead.

395

Long enough to complete Cold Harbor.

396

- See you tonight.
- All right.

397

- Good night, Mr. Scout.
- Good night, Judd.

398

Good morning, Mr. Scout.

399

Morning, Judd.

400

- Good night, Mr. Scout.
- Night, Judd.

401

Good morning, Mr. Scout.

402

Good morning, Judd.

403

- Mr. Scout.
- Good night, Judd.

404

<i>Hello? Is anyone there? Is the Board on?</i>

405

<i>It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement.</i>

406

<i>Okay. Well, if you're there,
please listen.</i>

407

<i>Now, I know that you want to
do the right thing for severed people,</i>

408

- <i>which is why I need to see my team again.</i>
- <i>Mark!</i>

409

<i>If we truly are the face
of severance reform, as you say,</i>

410

- <i>then they deserve a chance.</i>
- <i>Mark!</i>

411

<i>Please. They're my friends!
You can't just make them disappear!</i>

412

Of course, I bear full responsibility.

413

The Board's gonna give him what he wants,

414

including Helly R.

415

He won't finish without them.

416

Mr. Milchick?

417

Mr. George.

418

This is unheard of.

419

- I'm sorry, Mr. Wilkins.
- Three days of work.

420

I broke a fucking lease in Grand Rapids.

421

Fucking touch me.

422

Give me another reason to sue.

423

Fuck you, Lumon!

424

Hey, Judd.

425

<i>Subtitle extract by: Dream Ports</i>

426

Morning, Judd.

427

Hey!

428

Hello, Mark. Just back from work?

429

Where do you think you're going?

430

What do you care?

431

What do I care?

432

What do I c--

433

Who are you?

434

I thought you were quitting.

435

I trusted you.

436

I told you what I'd gone through
these past two years.

437

You...

438

You were in my house. You...

439

I ate your shitty fucking cookies.

440

They convinced you to stay?

441

Was a pineapple involved?

442

You're so easy to sway.

443

What? So that's it? You're just...
You're leaving?

444

Are you fucking kid--

445

Why did you do this?
What the fuck is this all about?

446

Do you know something about Gemma?
