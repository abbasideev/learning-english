1

Good morning, Mr. Scout.

2

One, two, three, four, five,

3

six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

4

Thirty-two, 33, 34,

5

35, 36, thirty-se--

6

Okay, me and Helly will find the goat man
and other possible goat people.

7

Dylan, hit the new break room.

8

Maybe some of
the other departments use it too.

9

Yeah. Maybe later.

10

Okay. This is kind of important, Dylan.

11

Yeah. I'm in a good groove here,
but don't worry about it. I'll get to it.

12

Okay. Well, just show them the sketch.
Do not leave it behind.

13

O&D.

14

Yes, Irv. You can do this.

15

I know.

16

You guys really think
they're gonna let us roam around?

17

They said on the video
we can go wherever we want.

18

Lumon is listening, remember?

19

I thought that meant
they were listening to our conversations.

20

Yeah, he's right, Mark.
I did get the hint of a double meaning.

21

Well, be discreet.

22

If they don't know we're doing it,
how can they punish us?

23

Hey,
you haven't been back there, have you?

24

No, no.

25

We've got you.

26

Thank you, Helly.

27

So, say we find her...

28

Sorry?

29

Say we get to the goat department
and they're like,

30

"Yes, Ms. Casey's here.
She's in this goat cage."

31

What do we do then?

32

Well, we get her to the south stairwell...
I'll go with her...

33

and once we're out the door,
my outie'll know what to do.

34

Right. Okay. Well,
sounds like you've got it figured out.

35

Are you sure you're okay
helping me out with this?

36

Yeah, of course.

37

Okay, good.

38

Yeah.

39

I... I...

40

Dylan.

41

I thought you were going to O&D.

42

Dylan.

43

I've recreated the paintings.

44

The ones I told you about.
The ones my outie was working on.

45

What?

46

You see, I've been thinking.

47

Maybe the hallway is really down here.

48

Maybe that's what my dreams have been.

49

We could look for it, Dylan.

50

We could go today.

51

You could accompany me.

52

Yeah.

53

Yeah, maybe.

54

Or maybe you go yourself,
like, for stealth, you know?

55

- Stealth?
- Yeah.

56

Look, I can't really explain. I just--

57

Miss Huang.

58

{\an8}Hall pass.

59

Everything chill?

60

Dylan G., come with me, please.

61

Good morning, Seth.

62

Natalie.

63

Looks like your balloons
could use some coffee.

64

- They were in the--
- I've got the Board.

65

Of course.

66

Hello.

67

The Board says, "Hello."

68

Hello. I want to thank the Board humbly
for my recent betterment.

69

The Board says, "You're welcome."

70

The Board is jubilant at your ascendance.

71

It wants you to feel appreciated
and asks if you do.

72

I do.

73

The Board austerely desires for you
to feel connected to Lumon's history.

74

To that end,

75

please accept from the Board these
inclusively re-canonicalized paintings

76

intended to help you see yourself
in Kier, our founder.

77

Oh, my.

78

You'll find the whole Kier cycle.

79

The Board wishes to express
that I, Natalie,

80

received the same gift
upon receipt of my current position

81

and found it extremely moving.

82

I'm grateful.

83

Yes.

84

It's meaningful
to see myself reflected in...

85

The Board has concluded the call.

86

Congratulations, Seth.

87

Is that it?

88

Think so.

89

You're gonna--

90

You sure?

91

Okay.

92

All right. Okay, we're doing this.

93

Can you see anything?

94

No. Careful, there's poop.

95

Okay.

96

Okay.

97

Oh, my God.

98

What the hell?

99

Are you here to kill me?

100

No, no, no, no, no, no.
I... Sorry. Hi, I'm Mark.

101

- I'm Helly.
- And we're with Macrodata Refinement.

102

What is this place?

103

Mammalians Nurturable.

104

Please, we mean you no harm.
We just wanna talk.

105

Please.

106

Irving.

107

Felicia, hello.

108

I'm sorry to pop in after all this time.

109

I'm sure you must be very busy.

110

It's good to see you.

111

Her name's Ms. Casey.

112

She's our former Wellness Director.

113

Wellness...

114

we don't abide such fripperies here.

115

Right. Well, she's been retired, but
we believe she may still be on the floor.

116

Are you sure you don't know her?

117

Maybe you should take that page
of paper and be on your way.

118

Not until you've answered my question.

119

Mark.

120

You should have left.

121

It would be cool to know
what this is about.

122

So, like, is it rude to keep asking
why you're a kid?

123

I don't mean to impugn.
It's just like, are you okay, you know?

124

They're not, like,
forcing you to be here, are they?

125

Oh, fuck.

126

Why are we going to the security room?

127

Wow.

128

Dylan?

129

Hi.

130

Hi.

131

Dylan G.,
through good behavior and output,

132

you've earned an 18-minute
visitation event with your outie's wife,

133

Gretchen G.

134

Cool.

135

Your time begins now.

136

Should we sit?

137

Nice sack.

138

Sorry?

139

Your... The--

140

Thanks. They made me put my stuff in here.

141

Badass.

142

You really don't know me at all?

143

No. Well, I mean,
from the photos from just now, but...

144

Yeah, Seth warned me
that this might be weird.

145

- Who's Seth?
- Don't you--

146

{\an8}<i>Please refrain from sharing information
that may be privileged or sensitive.</i>

147

{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

148

Okay.

149

Who is that child?

150

<i>Miss Huang.</i>

151

Look. It's really nice to meet you,
but am I in trouble?

152

Oh, no. No, you're not in trouble.

153

We have three kids.

154

Right.

155

And you...

156

No, he... Or--

157

My husband has had trouble
keeping other jobs.

158

He dumb?

159

No.

160

He a dick?

161

No.

162

What is wrong with him?

163

Nothing's wrong with him.

164

He just...

165

He never quite found his thing.

166

So he's actually kind of a fuck up?

167

Do you wanna see a picture of the kids?

168

Yeah.

169

Okay.

170

So, Jim is six.
He's in the first grade now.

171

And Ruth is four.

172

And Merrick just turned two.

173

Wow.

174

Holy shit.

175

Look at them.

176

They're awesome.

177

They are.

178

And we live on a cattle ranch?

179

And then... And Burt says,

180

"I don't care if
you're Baird goddamn Eagan,

181

you don't come to my department
and tell me how to print a snow globe."

182

I ca... My God, he was fearless.

183

I worked with Burt for six years.

184

And I only ever saw him
scared of one thing.

185

He spent two hours on his hair
the first time he went to visit you.

186

Really?

187

I should show you something.

188

- If we see her--
- Not her. It's a...

189

Here.

190

Oh, Irving, it's lovely.

191

I'd draw one every day I couldn't see him.

192

My numbers went down,
but I didn't even care.

193

Oh, no. That's not Burt.

194

That's something else.
That's just a... That's nothing.

195

It's...

196

How do you know about the exports hall?

197

I'm sorry?

198

We send a lot of shipments there.

199

Used to go ourselves.

200

But now, they send a guy.

201

Do you remember where it is?

202

Hello.

203

Hi.

204

- Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?
- Hey! Stop that!

205

Her name's Ms. Casey.
She was the Wellness director.

206

- Stop that!
- Have any of you seen her?

207

Enough! We've decided to send a courier
to inform Mr. Milchick of your inquiry.

208

No. You can't do that.
They could kill her if they find out--

209

That's not a Mammalians problem.

210

It's an innie problem.

211

Listen, we used to be afraid of
other departments too--

212

We're not afraid of you.

213

Look, they just disappeared her.

214

And if we let this happen to Ms. Casey,

215

then who's gonna step up
when it happens to us?

216

If one of your goats went missing,
wouldn't you go looking for it?

217

She used to come do her sessions
in our husbandry tanks.

218

She had a gentle way about her.

219

She said my outie excels at stargazing.

220

Meant a great deal to me.

221

As far as we know,
she was retired, just like they say.

222

But if you suspect otherwise,
we won't hinder your search.

223

Thank you.

224

Yes, thank you.

225

But before you go, we would...

226

like to see your bellies.

227

Our bellies?

228

Please.

229

Okay.

230

See? Pouchless.

231

Proves nothing.

232

Okay. Let's--

233

- So we'll just... Yeah.
- Yeah.

234

I'm glad we did this.

235

I mean, I hope, for you, this was...
I don't know.

236

Yeah, it was.

237

And I'll be good.
I'm gonna make you all proud.

238

I'm always proud of you, Dylan.

239

Cool.

240

I love you.

241

Sorry.

242

- Habit.
- No, it's...

243

Okay.

244

All right.

245

- Bye.
- Yeah.

246

So remember Merrick's ear thing, okay?

247

Copy that.

248

- Left ear.
- Yep.

249

And did you do the cookies
for Jim's class?

250

Bye.

251

It's our week for cookies.

252

I did not do the cookies. Sorry.

253

So, it's a tube
and you just need to slice them

254

- and then you put them in the oven.
- Got it, yeah.

255

Love you.

256

Hey, how was the thing?

257

What thing?

258

The thing with me.

259

Yeah, it was good.

260

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

261

Weird good, but good.

262

Cool.

263

Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll see you in the morning.

264

- Bye.
- Bye.

265

"But surely beer and juleps
cannot fill the void left by love.

266

Indeed, only wine can achieve this,
but it is famously costly,

267

which is why sadness is among the most
recurrent issues facing the poor."

268

Remarkable. So astute.

269

Is it? That's what I was going for.

270

Hi.

271

My babe.

272

This is Natalie Kalen from Lumon.

273

Is everything okay?

274

Yes. God, yes.

275

Natalie just stopped by
to discuss my book, actually.

276

It's a joy to meet you, Devon.
You must be so proud.

277

I am.

278

I'm sure you know by now
that your husband's work

279

has found its way onto our severed floor.

280

Yeah. Do we know how that happened yet?

281

So we've actually moved beyond that,
and we are now discussing the--

282

What was the term you used?

283

- The result.
- The result.

284

Ricken's words have had a profound effect
upon our workers.

285

We think he's really tapped
into something.

286

And Natalie wants to discuss
a version of <i>The You You Are</i>,

287

specifically for innies.

288

Okay, well, that's cool. I mean,
but what's wrong with the current version?

289

Nothing.

290

No, the explanation
is actually very interesting.

291

It's fascinating, actually. You, please.

292

There's a certain verbiage
to which innies respond more favorably.

293

If we just tweak it here and there.

294

They think that it could be
a real game changer.

295

Gotcha.

296

I gotta go.
But she needs a bottle in an hour. So...

297

Of course.

298

- Devon.
- Yes?

299

Can I just say, your brother is one of
the sweetest members of our severed team.

300

Yeah, he's a good egg.

301

Okay. One hour.

302

So she said her name's Natalie?

303

Natalie Kalen, I think.

304

What... Was she asking,
like, what I'm up to or--

305

Nope, 'cause it's Ricken they're after.

306

- Ricken?
- Yep. His book.

307

What?

308

I guess you and your work friends
were so inspired by it.

309

- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yep.

310

That they're... They wanna do
like an innie specific cut.

311

Wow, okay. Well, there's just...
There's a lot I'm not gonna say.

312

And that is so appreciated.

313

Have you told Ricken
what we're doing here?

314

- Are you insane? No.
- Okay.

315

Good.

316

Okay, so you need to see the afterimage
for, like, two and a half minutes?

317

Two minutes, 18 seconds.

318

It's from the parking spot
to the elevator, give or take.

319

Yeah, I think the Whole Mind Collective
would be very proud of this.

320

As well as your kindergarten teacher.

321

What the fuck was her name?
Mrs. Lustgarten?

322

- Yeah, Mrs. Lustgarten. Yeah.
- Wow.

323

She really got me.

324

Yeah. Fuck, I gotta skedaddle.

325

Will you be careful, please?

326

Yeah.

327

Okay.

328

I do love you.

329

Okay.

330

Even thought you left me
with the check at Pips, you dick.

331

Thanks.

332

You're welcome.

333

Two, three, four, five,

334

six, seven,

335

eight, nine, ten,

336

11, 12. Shit.

337

Fuck.

338

If you want me back,
you must accommodate my needs.

339

I'm listening.

340

MDR. Non-negotiable.

341

Mark S. is so close
to completing Cold Harbor.

342

I intend to finish the work
that I started,

343

which is why

344

Milchick must go.

345

He's not equipped for the task.

346

I must be floor manager.

347

I hear ego...

348

hubris...

349

arrogance.

350

Kier teaches us they only cause pain.

351

Everything I accomplished, I earned...

352

through dedication and industry,

353

not because I was born into it.

354

I think you've overestimated
your contributions

355

and underestimated your blessings.

356

We didn't have to ask you back.

357

You didn't have a choice.

358

Are you sure?

359

Why don't we reset?

360

It doesn't have to be this way.

361

Natalie.

362

Please see if the Board is available

363

for Ms. Cobel and myself.

364

Let's go speak with them together.

365

Harmony.

366

Thirty-three, 34, 35, 36,

367

thirty s--

368

Jesus Christ.

369

Are you trying to burn a message
to your innie into your retinas

370

because your computer told you
that was a brilliant idea?

371

Yeah.

372

No, no. What? No, no, no, no, no.

373

What are you... What?

374

It doesn't work.

375

- No shit.
- The switch briefly dilates the pupils.

376

Clean slate.

377

- Okay, thank you. Thanks.
- Also, you could blind yourself.

378

And how was the innie
gonna send you a message back?

379

That's his problem. I don't know.

380

Mark, unlock the door.

381

Why?

382

We need to talk.

383

- Oh, my God.
- Mark, unlock the--

384

Mark, unlock this fucking door!

385

Goddamn it. This goddamn fucking thing.

386

- What?
- There's an easier way.

387

Didn't seem particularly easy for Petey.

388

Heard about the OTC.

389

Yeah, my sister talked to my innie.
He said a lot of things.

390

Did he tell her
your wife is alive at Lumon?

391

Who told you that?

392

Is she?

393

Is Gemma alive?

394

She was, the last time I saw her.

395

How could you not tell me?

396

We were interrupted, if you recall.

397

Mark, I want to help you,
but you have to trust me.

398

How the fu...

399

There is one way, and one way only,
to get information in and out of Lumon,

400

and that's reintegration.

401

I'm better at it now.
I can make it work with you.

402

I can sew together a version of you that
loves her with a version of you that can--

403

Yes. Do it.

404

You're sure?

405

I wanna see my wife.

406

The monitors differentiate
the five brain wave frequencies

407

of the innie and outie.

408

Delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma.

409

One frequency, two waves per oscilloscope.

410

The waves aren't in sync. Not yet, anyway.

411

That's what we're here to do.

412

Lean forward.

413

Is it gonna hurt?

414

Ideally not.

415

What does your mouth taste like?

416

Nothing.
Good.

418

What the fuck?

419

Shit.

420

You all right?

421

I don't know. Am I?

422

I'm gonna start with easy questions
and get more complex.

423

Do you remember protocol?

424

- Is that the first question?
- No, we haven't started yet.

425

Yes, I remember.

426

Relax your body. You should feel good
when this is over. Who am I?

427

Okay, so are--

428

We've started. Who am I?

429

Asal Reghabi.

430

Where are we?

431

My basement.

432

What was your mother's name?

433

Fern Scout.

434

What was her eye color?

435

Seriously?

436

Brown. It was brown.

437

Did you love her?

438

Yeah.

439

Name a dam.

440

Hoover.

441

What does MDR stand for?

442

What?

443

MDR.

444

- Mystic--
- That's wrong.

445

What is something
for which you feel shame?

446

Shame.

447

My dog died when I was a kid.
It was my fault.

448

Why?

449

I left the gate open.

450

Where were you born?

451

I'm not sure.

452

What month is it?

453

You mean, what quarter?

454

Wait.

455

What is your first memory?

456

- I don't know.
- Tell me.

457

Holy shit.

458

- I don't know. I don't remember.
- Tell me.

459

- Tell me your first memory.
- I don't remember.

460

<i>Hey there, you on the table.</i>

461

<i>I wonder if you'd mind taking
a brief survey.</i>

462

<i>Five questions.</i>

463

<i>To start out, who are you?</i>
