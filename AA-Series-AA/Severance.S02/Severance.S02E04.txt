Hello!

2

Hello!

3

Irving!

4

- It's me. I'm up here!
- Mark!

5

Yeah!

6

Hey!

7

What's happening?

8

Where are we?

9

I have no fucking idea,

10

but there's a path up the cliff
right down there!

11

Do you want me to come up?

12

Well, yeah!

13

I'm on the ice. I'm on the fucking ice!

14

Maybe get off of it. Come on!

15

I'm coming!

16

I'm--

17

I'm coming!

18

Be careful!

19

It's very steep!

20

Irving.

21

Helly!

22

Where did you come from?

23

I don't know.

24

What are we doing out here?

25

Up here!

26

Follow my voice!

27

Mark!

28

Mark!

29

Up here!

30

Mark.

31

Hey!

32

Are you okay?

33

- Did you wake up on the ice too?
- Yeah.

34

- What about you?
- On the cliff.

35

Oh, my God.

36

- Is it you?
- Of course it's us.

37

Holy shit!

38

Out-fucking-side.

39

Oh, my God. I mean,
I knew there was no actual ceiling,

40

but this is fucking insane.

41

Hello?

42

Hello?

43

What is that?

44

<i>Good morning, Refiners.</i>

45

<i>This is Mr. Milchick from work,
and I'm thrilled to welcome you</i>

46

<i>to your first ever</i>

47

<i>outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence.</i>

48

<i>This ORTBO is in response
to your desire to see the outside world.</i>

49

<i>With your outies' blessings,</i>

50

<i>you will spend the next two calendar days
walking the meadows,</i>

51

<i>thickets, brambles and brooks that
make up the Dieter Eagan National Forest.</i>

52

Who the fuck is Dieter Eagan?

53

<i>Dieter Eagan?</i>

54

<i>Some of you may be
quietly yearning to learn more.</i>

55

<i>The truth you seek lies
within the fourth appendix.</i>

56

<i>Kier dictated a fourth
appendix in his final hours of life,</i>

57

<i>a text of such sanctity that it
is forbidden upon the severed floor.</i>

58

<i>It's waiting for you in Scissor Cave,</i>

59

<i>the very same grotto</i>

60

<i>where Kier Eagan tamed the four
tempers for the very first time.</i>

61

<i>And do remember,</i>

62

<i>"Stray not from Kier's path,
lest you roil nature's wrath."</i>

63

<i>There will be help along the way.</i>

64

<i>Happy fortunes, MDR.</i>

65

Scissor Cave.

66

What the fuck is that?

67

He looks like Mark.

68

Milchick said there'd
be help along the way.

69

I wouldn't trust a word out of that
mountebank's mouth.

70

Not even televisually.

71

Not like we have a lot of
other options right now, Irv.

72

Wait.

73

{\an8}"Chapter one.

74

{\an8}I was not born into this world alone.

75

The lodgings of my mother's
womb I shared with another,

76

a twin brother who was called Dieter."

77

Kier had a twin?

78

That's what those things are.

79

Yeah.

80

"In infancy, he was my bosom friend.
But as we blossomed into boyhood,

81

he beseeched me to take to
the wood with him to live as paupers.

82

My love for my twin
unbalancing my judgment,

83

I acceded, and we ventured
into the wood towards"...

84

"Woe's Hollow."

85

So,
we're to walk in the brothers' footsteps.

86

{\an8}"He always crept like this at this hour.

87

{\an8}- Once concealed by flora, my brother"...
- <i>...flora, my brother</i>

88

<i>unfastened himself.</i>

89

<i>The din of his fervor fell strangely
into concert with the music of the wood.</i>

90

<i>His every thrust found rhythm</i>

91

- <i>with the trill of the crickets...</i>
- ..."trill of the crickets"...

92

- <i>...and the moaning of the wind...</i>
- ..."and the moaning of the wind"...

93

- <i>...and the snowfall's yearly thaw.</i>
- ..."and the snowfall's yearly thaw."

94

<i>Dieter became, on that night</i>

95

- <i>an instrument of nature...</i>
- ..."an instrument of nature"...

96

- <i>...and nature played Dieter...</i>
- "and nature played Dieter with elegance.

97

I had no choice but to listen

98

as he spilt his lineage upon the soil."

99

Now there's a me one.

100

You okay?

101

Yeah.

102

I just wish I knew where we were going.

103

Fuck.

104

What were you and Helly
talking about back there?

105

When?

106

I don't trust her.

107

I think she might be lying
about what her outie saw.

108

Why would you think that?

109

Night gardeners.

110

It's clear you do not have
an objective perspective

111

due to your feelings for her.

112

My feelings for her have
nothing to do with anything, okay--

113

What the fuck?

114

What is it?

115

I don't know.

116

Looks like a seal.

117

Why does it look so messed up?

118

I don't know.
Maybe this is what dead things look like.

119

We should eat it.

120

Pardon me?

121

We don't know if there's
food waiting at the hollow.

122

We don't even know where we are.

123

They can't let anything happen to us.

124

It's an ORTBO.

125

Outdoor retreat team-building occurrence.
Right, Mark?

126

We don't know what this is.

127

- We don't know anything!
- Irving, calm down.

128

We all know you had a bad experience
the last time you were outside--

129

Who said I had a bad experience?

130

Oh, my God.

131

What did you tell him, dumbass?

132

Nothing! What the fuck?

133

Let's just get to the hollow.

134

Kier's twin was always with him.

135

That's why we provided
the very same for each of you.

136

Fuck you all. I was right.

137

Mr. Milchick.

138

This is the tallest waterfall
on the planet.

139

You have followed the path of Kier
and Dieter, and reached Woe's Hollow.

140

You stand upon sacred earth.

141

We're starving, Mr. Milchick.

142

Are you?

143

I thought the waterfall's
grandeur would satiate you.

144

I'm teasing, of course.

145

Lumon will always protect and provide.

146

Right this way.

147

Miss Huang has been readying the grill for
which we brought in copious luxury meats.

148

The fire will be used for
marshmallows and a recital later.

149

The tents, as you can see, are MDR blue

150

and the outhouse is stocked
with four-ply washroom tissue.

151

Wow.

152

Wow, indeed, Helly R.

153

Also, for your
comfort and safety, torches,

154

which can provide both
a heat and a light source.

155

Double duty.

156

It's beautiful.

157

Pretty cool, right?

158

Yes, lovely.

159

Irving?

160

Enter.

161

Made you a snow seal.

162

In case you were hungry.

163

Yeah.

164

I feel silly for suggesting
we eat that animal.

165

I suppose
it sounded alarmist and paranoid.

166

Irrational.

167

No. It was fine. We were all a little...

168

Yeah.

169

What did you really see
during the overtime contingency?

170

I told you.

171

It's okay.

172

It won't change anything.

173

Irving.

174

Okay.

175

"Dieter lay unwashed in his bedroll,

176

though the hollow's pool
was primed for bathing.

177

We ate of the hare we'd caught

178

and told each other rhyming jokes
till our gullets ached.

179

But at last,
the thought tickling my mouth emerged.

180

'We must return to Father,' I said.

181

'But I promise to look
after you in the ether mill.'

182

When at last a sound came from him,
it was a bewailing whimper.

183

He believed, I suppose,
that we'd be woodland paupers forever.

184

I was looking at him
when his eye came out.

185

It popped from the socket,

186

driven by a sudden torrent of pus
from his skull.

187

And he reached up to grasp at his hair,

188

which was suddenly moss that tore
easily from his bleeding scalp."

189

Good heavens.

190

"And as the pus
from his eye thickened into sap,

191

I turned from my gargling brother
and walked to the pool of the hollow,

192

where I knew the waterfall
would drown out my brother's cries."

193

That's actually really smart.

194

"And it was here that I
first encountered the temper Woe,

195

a gaunt bride,
half the height of a natural woman.

196

She spoke to me
directly from her eyes and said,

197

'This is your doing.

198

You suffered his wantonness.

199

Now he's no one's brother.

200

Only chaos's whore.'"

201

The end.

202

Perhaps in the morning,
we'll have time for the next chapter...

203

"Kier and the Thieving Nanny."

204

Creepy.

205

Did his brother really die that way,
Mr. Milchick?

206

The handbook enriches our work
with tales of the founder's life.

207

Every word is truth.

208

I'm sorry. Sorry.

209

Helly.

210

What?

211

- Helly R.?
- You guys...

212

He melted, right?

213

He turned into the forest
because he masturbated.

214

I mean, seriously, that's actually
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

215

Right? He jerked off
in front of his brother...

216

and he got punished for it.

217

Wha... You can't say that.

218

- He just said it.
- Wha... He did.

219

I... It's...

220

You know, we often laugh
at what we don't understand.

221

The team I thought I knew
would have processed more thoughtfully.

222

Miss Huang.

223

The marshmallows, please.

224

Throw them in the fire.

225

Mr. Milchick, come on.

226

Now, Miss Huang.

227

- Oh, my...
- Why?

228

Marshmallows are for team players, Dylan.

229

They don't just hand them out.

230

What?

231

Good night.

232

Wow.

233

Oh, my God.

234

Hey, what do you think
his dick turned into?

235

It isn't funny.

236

I don't know. It's pretty funny.

237

- Well, it's not.
- Okay.

238

And stop making goo-goo eyes at her.

239

- I'm not.
- Stop.

240

"Goo-goo eyes"?

241

Just tell us, Helly.

242

What?

243

Come on. Tell us.

244

Tell us what?

245

Just tell us about him.

246

Who?

247

The night gardener.

248

Irv, come on.

249

Did he have a flashlight?

250

What was he wearing?

251

What is your deal right now, dude?

252

What color was his shirt?

253

Did he have on a vest?

254

- A luminescent vest? Tell us...
- Okay.

255

- ...exactly what he was wear--
- Irving. That's enough.

256

- Enough?
- Yeah.

257

Using your pupils to make love to her

258

while your outie's wife
rots away somewhere.

259

Hey, shut up.

260

Yeah. Fuck you, Irv.

261

So it's three against one now, huh?

262

It's okay.

263

We all know Irving's upset
because he can't ever see Burt again.

264

And he's really lonely.

265

Hey, Irv.

266

Fuck you all.

267

Probably a carrot.

268

What?

269

Dieter's penis.

270

Yeah, or some other root vegetable.

271

That was mean of me...

272

to say that to Irving.

273

I mean, he kind of deserved it.

274

And I can make goo-goo eyes
at anyone I want.

275

Are you okay?

276

Sorry if I'm distracting you from...

277

From what?

278

From looking for your wife.

279

Hey, it's okay.

280

I know we'll find her,
and you've already helped so much.

281

I have?

282

Yeah.

283

Okay.

284

Mr. Milchick!

285

Mr. Milchick!

286

Miss Huang!

287

Mr. Milchick!

288

Miss Huang!

289

Mr. Milchick!

290

I didn't like who I was on the outside.

291

I was ashamed.

292

Who were you?

293

I don't care who you are out there.

294

I care who you are with me.

295

That's all.

296

Okay?

297

Are you okay?

298

What happened?

299

Are you okay?

300

Yeah.

301

Okay.

302

Helly?

303

Helly?

304

Hey, where's Helly?

305

I don't know. Irv never came back
last night, and he's not in his tent.

306

What?

307

Mr. Milchick?

308

Helly!

309

Mr. Milchick!

310

Mark.

311

Mark. Dylan, what's happened?

312

Helly and Irv are missing.

313

What the fuck is going on?

314

Hey, kid.

315

Irving.

316

What are you doing down here?

317

What are you doing down here?

318

I slept outside.

319

I almost froze to death.

320

What you said to me last night,

321

it was cruel.

322

Helly was never cruel.

323

I'm right here.

324

So if you're not her...

325

then who are you?

326

Who would have the power to send
their outie to the severed floor?

327

I'm sorry.

328

No! Irving!

329

Mr. Milchick!

330

- No. No!
- Come on.

331

- Irving. Stop. Irving, no.
- Mr. Milchick!

332

Please, stop.

333

Help!

334

- Mr. Milchick!
- No!

335

Irving?

336

Mr. Milchick!

337

Irving!

338

Mr. Milchick!

339

- Come!
- Mark!

340

Mr. Milchick!

341

Mr. Milchick!

342

- Mark!
- Helly!

343

- Turn her back, Mr. Milchick!
- Help!

344

What are you doing, man?

345

- Turn her back!
- Irv, what the fuck?

346

She's an outie!

347

- Hey! Irving, stop it!
- Hey! Irv, cut it out!

348

- Stop!
- She's been an outie the whole time,

349

ever since she came back!

350

- Irving, you stop now!
- Stop it!

351

Irving, stop this!

352

She's a fucking mole!

353

What are you doing?

354

- Irving!
- I'm gonna kill her, Mr. Milchick!

355

Irving! Irving!

356

Stop! Stop this!

357

She's not Helly!

358

She's an Eagan!

359

Turn her back, Mr. Milchick!
Turn her back!

360

Goddamn it, Seth, do it!

361

Yes! Do it, Seth!

362

Hey!

363

It's Milchick.
Remove the Glasgow block now.

364

Now!

365

I'm sorry.

366

I'm so sorry, Helly.

367

What's happening?

368

Helly!

369

I'm sorry, Helly.

370

Irving B., stand.

371

You have threatened collegial murder
in the pond of Woe's Hollow.

372

For this, there can be no penalty
but immediate and permanent dismissal.

373

There shall be no formal valediction,
catered or otherwise.

374

Your outie will be notified forthwith.

375

Irv! I'm sorry!

376

I should have listened!

377

It's okay. It's all okay.

378

Just remember, hang in there.

379

Please refrain from any further speech,

380

as you are no longer authorized
to consort with any severed employee,

381

nor they with you.

382

Leave him alone!
Turn around!

383

Leave him alone!

384

Walk into the forest.
