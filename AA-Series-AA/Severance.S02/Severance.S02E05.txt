1

Do you have them?

2

Thank you.

3

- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

4

<i>How was the weekend thing?</i>

5

Good, I guess.

6

Although my innie fell off a rope, apparently.

7

<i>A rope?</i>

8

<i>Are you hurt?</i>

9

No, I just got a little wet, that's all.

10

<i>Jesus, it's like it never ends
with these guys.</i>

11

<i>Do you know what the fuck
actually happened?</i>

12

I have no idea.

13

<i>Fuck. Well, how's the old "burning
shit into your eyeballs" thing going?</i>

14

I still can't get it to last long enough.

15

<i>Okay. So, what do we do?</i>

16

Just keep trying, I guess.

17

<i>Do you have any other ideas?</i>

18

Hey, I'm sorry. I gotta get to work.

19

- <i>All right. Bye.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

20

- Hey.
- You need to get your dryer fixed.

21

Yeah. Or you could just,
like, not live here.

22

I can't keep coming in and out.

23

You think they're watching us?

24

Depends on how dumb you've played it.

25

Hey, when do we keep going?

26

Maybe tonight. I'll decide later.

27

'Cause I haven't remembered anything else.

28

Right. Well, maybe your innie has.

29

You took the rest of the weekend
to recover?

30

I'm fine.

31

Will I be updating Father later?

32

He should hear it from me.

33

We have decided to spare him knowledge
of this contretemps.

34

Well, please let him know
that his daughter is alive and well.

35

The medical team
says your tempers will rebalance quickly.

36

Good to hear.

37

Some residual trauma is to be expected
after such an ordeal.

38

Perhaps we could arrange
another obligement session this evening.

39

I said I'm fine.

40

We're close, Helena.

41

What's he at, 78%?

42

Eighty-one. As of Friday.

43

It won't be much longer.

44

You can do this.

45

I'm not going back down there.

46

It won't be you. It will be your innie.

47

My innie who tried to kill me?

48

And then the other one tried to kill me.

49

They're fucking animals.

50

I'll just fake it again.

51

We can't take that chance.

52

We need to clean this up.

53

Milchick's many errors this weekend
have forced our hand.

54

And Father approves?

55

Father encouraged it.

56

<i>It's a risk.</i>

57

<i>We know this.</i>

58

<i>But there is no other solution.</i>

59

<i>Mark S. won't work without her.</i>

60

And the work is mysterious and important.

61

So we must give him her.

62

<i>The Board appreciates your sacrifice.</i>

63

Good morning, Helly R.

64

Who the fuck are you?

65

I'm Miss Huang.

66

What the hell?

67

Please follow me.

68

Mr. Milchick will explain.

69

- Hey.
- Hey.

70

- Is she...
- Her innie.

71

MDR.

72

Together again.

73

Come on in.

74

I need to know what's going on.

75

Like, right now.

76

Where's Irving?

77

And why was he trying to drown me?

78

'Cause you're a fucking Eagan.

79

- Was she spying on us?
- Wait, what?

80

The whole time.

81

It's called a Glasgow block.

82

- It allows one's outie to--
- Wait.

83

Are you saying that she was down here?

84

As me?

85

Maybe she still is.

86

Hey, I repeat myself. Where is Irving?

87

- Yeah, where is he?
- I'm so confused.

88

Answer my question!

89

Excuse me.

90

Helena Eagan, in her executive capacity,
was conducting valuable research.

91

By stealing my fucking body?

92

Irving had no knowledge of what
management's intention was in this action,

93

and in so doing, he nearly drowned you.

94

Our only option was permanent dismissal.

95

So he is dead?

96

No.

97

Irving B's outie has departed
on an elongated cruise voyage.

98

I don't give three dry fucks
about his outie.

99

She doesn't have
the right to take my identity.

100

Have you ever heard the story
of the <i>Gråkappan</i>?

101

Let's assume we haven't.

102

In ancient times,
the king of Sweden himself

103

was known to go incognito
amongst his people

104

in the hopes of learning
their true grievances.

105

He would don an old, gray robe,
a <i>Gråkappan</i>,

106

the name for which he was remembered,

107

to disguise his royal vestments.

108

Kier Eagan himself was known
to do so in his ether factories,

109

and Ms. Eagan
was carrying on this noble tradition.

110

This smells like horseshit.

111

Yeah. Swedish horseshit,
and Irving is still dead.

112

As I said, Irving B's outie
has departed on an elonga--

113

On an elongated cruise voyage.
Yeah, I know.

114

Is he gonna come back or not?

115

He is not.

116

Wow. Some actual honesty.

117

You fucking murderers.

118

You can't do this to people.

119

It will take time to absorb
all that has occurred.

120

This went well.

121

Allow me to escort you to MDR

122

and help reacclimate you
to your work environment.

123

What in the abominable fuck?

124

This is you.

125

Hell no. I'm not going near that thing.

126

Dylan, please.

127

If you're taking feedback, I hate it.

128

Same.

129

Well, the ORTBO was a challenge for us all
in ways expected and non.

130

You mean like Jame Eagan's daughter
<i>Gråkappanning</i> us?

131

Careful, Dylan. Words have consequences.

132

I'd hate to rescind certain privileges.

133

As you can see, all of your items

134

have been moved
to your new work tri-stations.

135

Hall passes will still be available.

136

Let us have a funeral.

137

I'm sorry?

138

Irving is a person, and he's gone.

139

So,

140

we'd like to have a funeral.

141

Not a retirement party, a funeral.

142

Right?

143

Yeah.

144

A funeral.

145

Is this MDR's position?

146

Dude?

147

Little help?

148

Sure. As long as it's quick.

149

- Quick?
- Quick. Yes.

150

So it doesn't take up the whole day.

151

Well said, Mark.

152

I'll see if we can
pull something together.

153

In the meantime, let's make some
forward progress on the files at hand.

154

Shall we?

155

Thank you.

156

Not you.

157

Miss Huang, we need to ready
a bereavement kit for MDR.

158

Meet me in the back office.

159

Mark?

160

Hello?

161

I'm gonna come in.

162

I'm coming in.

163

Hey.

164

Are you okay?

165

Uh-huh. No, not really.

166

Yeah. This is seriously fucked up.

167

Yeah.

168

You couldn't tell?

169

That she wasn't me?

170

Obviously not.

171

What was she like?

172

Like you.

173

Or you're like her? I don't know.

174

I don't know who you are, I guess.

175

Yes, you do.

176

Okay.

177

It's not my fault
that my outie hijacked me.

178

Yeah. No, totally. I get it. It sucks.

179

- Mark...
- Yeah.

180

What happened to you up there?

181

Doesn't matter.

182

- It doesn't matter?
- No.

183

Don't you want to hear
what happened to me?

184

No, I don't.
And let's just try to forget it. Okay?

185

I thought bereavement events
were for innies who die on the floor.

186

Yes.

187

Well, the Affections Index for Irving B.
was in the high 60s.

188

It will help the others to grieve.

189

May I say a question?

190

You may.

191

You shouldn't let them have a funeral.

192

It makes them feel like people.

193

That wasn't a question.

194

That was an opinion.

195

Unsolicited.

196

Your first performance review
is today, right?

197

That was a question.

198

I'll ready the refreshments.

199

You focus on the mournful signage.

200

<i>Today we honor Irving B.</i>

201

<i>Normally, when an innie
goes to be with Kier,</i>

202

<i>we hold a retirement party,
which they attend.</i>

203

But given the sudden
and frigid events which brought us here,

204

that's not feasible.

205

As such, let us each take nine seconds

206

to silently remember Irving
and thank Kier for our time with him.

207

There. You may now lift your heads
and open your eyes.

208

We will now have a eulogy from Dylan G.

209

It's hard to pinpoint
a favorite Irving story.

210

For the least fun guy in the world,
he was really fun.

211

He put the "dick" in contradiction.

212

One time, he was pissed at me
for watering down the toner,

213

so he put toner in my water cup.

214

He stopped me before I drank it, though.

215

He just wanted to make a point,
not harm me physically.

216

But I did accidentally take a sip of it
later 'cause I forgot he said that.

217

He asked me for help with something
near the end, and I didn't listen.

218

And in his final moments,

219

he would have been totally justified
in telling me to suck my own fuck.

220

But he didn't.

221

Yeah.

222

He was awesome, and I miss him.

223

Thank you, Dylan G.

224

A little sugar with your usual salt.

225

Thank you for your attendance
and your participation.

226

You may now briefly partake
in Irving's fruit head,

227

whose dark hair is courtesy
of the Black Beauty Watermelon.

228

From the country of Malaysia.

229

Miss Huang.

230

I thought I was going to perform.

231

Yes, well, I feel the theremin
works best in moderation.

232

- But I practiced--
- You can play your piece for me later.

233

Yes?

234

You okay?

235

How about you?

236

Okay.

237

You're not staying?

238

I gotta get to work,
but great ceremony, guys.

239

Seriously?

240

I mean, isn't it kind of over?

241

Mark...

242

Just let him go.

243

- What?
- Irving was your friend, and he's dead.

244

- Why don't you give a shit?
- Because he's not dead.

245

He's just not here.

246

You two catch up?

247

What's that?

248

You tell her Ms. Casey's your wife yet?

249

Wait, what?

250

Yeah, I mean,
it's my outie's wife, but sure...

251

No, it's pretty crazy.

252

Mark.

253

Mark, what the hell?

254

- Why won't you talk to me?
- What do you want to talk about, Helly?

255

I don't know. Maybe the fact
that Ms. Casey's your outie's wife?

256

What are we gonna do?

257

Well, we're not gonna do anything.

258

Not gonna do anything?

259

- Seriously?
- Yes. Seriously.

260

Come on. We'll work as a team.
We'll figure this out.

261

- "We'll"? There's no "we," Helly.
- What?

262

- It doesn't matter.
- Why?

263

- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

264

Because they are smarter than us, okay?

265

They know everything.

266

Me looking for Ms. Casey,

267

us wandering around,
meeting other departments,

268

mapping the floor, all of it.

269

They know everything we're doing

270

because Helena told them
everything we're doing.

271

That wasn't me.

272

Mark, lo... I'm not her. I'm not.

273

I'm me.

274

Helly.

275

And how do I know that?

276

You don't.

277

You just have to trust me.

278

This is real.

279

Not everything here is a lie.

280

And stop being a fucking asshole.

281

Your first performance review
as Department Chief. Excited?

282

Very much so.

283

Shall we?

284

Natalie, just before we begin,

285

I was wondering
if I could have a word with you.

286

The paintings.

287

I want you to understand
I am grateful for them.

288

Truly.

289

If they're a measure of appreciation,
then I accept that appreciation.

290

I was just wondering
if you could share with me a little

291

how you felt
when you received the paintings.

292

Because I'm thinking

293

our experiences here
have been similar in some ways,

294

we face similar challenges,

295

and perhaps the paintings and the
somewhat complicated feelings they evoke.

296

Mr. Drummond's waiting.

297

Yes, of course.

298

Let us go.

299

Okay, asshole.

300

Guess this is it.

301

Sorry I let you down.

302

<i>Welcome, Mr. Milchick.</i>

303

Today, I will be conducting
your monthly performance review.

304

This review can take
anywhere from two to six hours,

305

depending on the number of atonements
and approbations required.

306

If the review is to take longer
than four hours,

307

there will be a break for lunch,
with the order taken in advance.

308

Well, I hope that won't be necessary.

309

Here is the lunch menu.

310

Let's start with the positives.

311

You received the gift
of Kier paintings with grace.

312

Your attendance and urinalysis
are both in the excellent range.

313

Wonderful.

314

Alternatively and sadly,

315

there have been three contentions
reported anonymously

316

which have been investigated
and confirmed.

317

"One: uses too many big words."

318

Well, perchance I may
colloquially employ a--

319

Anti-deflections will be heard
after the lunch break.

320

Yes, sorry.

321

Two: on several of your daily logs,

322

the paper clip
was installed back to front,

323

which led to a confusion as to where
in the document to begin reading.

324

Here are the incidents.

325

But the bulk of our day
will revolve around the following.

326

You brought in
a new refining team for Mark S.

327

which failed to coalesce.

328

You instituted kindness reforms.

329

Because I'm not Harmony Cobel.

330

Kindness reforms
that seemed to have, in no way,

331

deterred curiosity or idling by the team
once they returned.

332

You arranged an outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence

333

which resulted in the termination
of one employee,

334

and the discovery
of the true identity of another

335

at great risk and harm to the Eagan name.

336

<i>Look, Seth, Mark Scout's completion
of Cold Harbor...</i>

337

will be remembered

338

as one of the greatest moments
in the history of this planet.

339

It will take place under your stewardship.

340

<i>That's quite a legacy you will leave.</i>

341

<i>Thank you, Mr. Drummond.</i>

342

That means a great deal.

343

<i>This milestone seems
to have clouded your judgment.</i>

344

I think it's time to go
back to the basics, Seth.

345

To remember these severed workers'
greater purpose...

346

and to treat them as what they really are.

347

I'm tightening the leash.

348

Hi, Mark.

349

Mr. Milchick.

350

I see you left work six minutes early.

351

May I come in?

352

How was the rest of the funeral?

353

Did you get what you needed from it?

354

Yeah, sure.

355

Hey, did Miss Huang take notes?

356

I can't wait to read her article about it
in that newspaper you showed me.

357

What was it called again?

358

<i>The Bullshit Gazette</i>?

359

Hopefully, now we can put
all this grief and tumult behind us

360

and look forward
to some productive workdays ahead.

361

You mean
putting the numbers in the thing--

362

- Refining.
- Right.

363

Yes. Does that sound good?

364

Whatever you say, Mr. Milchick.

365

Praise Kier.

366

Did you and Helly R. catch up?

367

We did.

368

Did you tell her that you
fucked her outie at the ORTBO?

369

Helena Eagan,

370

leader-in-waiting of this company.

371

Have a restful evening.

372

<i>"The workers were diligent,</i>

373

<i>focused on the task at hand.</i>

374

<i>Pleasantly surprised, I noticed
that not a single worker had a watch.</i>

375

<i>They simply referenced
a large standard clock near the door,</i>

376

<i>just hands and numbers
and cogs and purpose.</i>

377

Your sovereign boss may own the clock
that greets you from the wall,

378

but you get to enjoy its ticking
and thus should be happy."

379

Yes.

380

Babe, it's the literal opposite
of what you were saying before.

381

Okay.

382

I see how you'd feel that way.

383

But one point that Nat made was--

384

Nat, okay.

385

She said that innies tend to thrive
in an environment of structure,

386

and once that is established,

387

then they are more open to self-expansion.

388

So I am just trying
to speak their language.

389

I know, but this sounds
like Lumon's language.

390

Well, it's a Trojan's horse.

391

If I can get my ideas
to severed workers all across the world,

392

it might beget a revolution.

393

But these aren't your ideas.

394

These are not your ideas, and also...

395

Whatever.

396

And what?

397

Okay, Lumon hurts people, you know that,
and if you want to water down your work

398

so they can use it
for their fucking propaganda,

399

then you're hurting people too.

400

Okay. I will reflect on your words.

401

Thank you.

402

And also,

403

this is a fiscal and creative opportunity

404

unlike any I have yet seen.

405

And I'm not inclined
to just walk away from it.

406

Unless me selling
millions of copies of my book

407

and the life that that manages to give us
has somehow lost its appeal for you.

408

Okay. Whatever. I'm gonna go to bed.

409

No. Babe.

410

No, thank you.

411

It's me again.

412

So, they fired me.

413

I think they knew what my innie was up to.

414

I'm telling you to--

415

I have to go.

416

Hey!

417

Hey!

418

You. Why are you following me?

419

I got this thing.

420

When somebody shows up on my doorstep
screaming my name, I wanna know why.

421

Call it a quirk.

422

You're with Lumon.

423

Why were you at my house the other night?

424

I don't know.

425

It wasn't you at all, was it?

426

You're severed.

427

I got canned a couple of weeks ago.

428

When I pressed them for a reason,

429

they said my innie had an unsanctioned,
erotic entanglement with another worker.

430

They wouldn't tell me who.

431

Then you show up at my door.

432

You think we were an item?

433

Well, Fields certainly thinks so.

434

We had to cancel our trip to Milwaukee.
Thanks for that.

435

- Fields?
- That's my husband, Fields.

436

I'm sorry.

437

Yeah, well...

438

And I'm sorry I came at you just now.

439

It's fine.

440

Maybe you could-- I don't know.

441

What?

442

We got a ham.
We're planning to have it tomorrow.

443

Might be nice if you come over.
We could sit down, talk through it all.

444

You, me, and...

445

Fields.

446

I suppose.

447

Great.

448

We like red wine.

449

Expensive.

450

Okay. Tomorrow.

451

You need a lift?

452

I'll walk. Thanks.

453

You sure?

454

I know where you live.

455

- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

456

Sorry there wasn't any eggnog.

457

Might be out of season.

458

What the fuck are you doing?

459

I needed some pressure points.
Things to rattle your memories.

460

- Knitting?
- Yeah.

461

She said it gave her time to think.

462

That her?

463

What I thought was her.

464

She's not dead. She's just not here.

465

Who's in there?

466

They know people at the morgue.

467

On the payroll,
like everywhere else in Kier.

468

You feel all right?

469

Basically. So, are we gonna...

470

One more day.

471

Usually that's best.

472

Usually? You've done this once.

473

I don't wanna rush things.

474

There's risk.

475

It's not an exact science, Mark.

476

I'm not sure it's science,
period, but okay.

477

You good on snacks?

478

For now.

479

Are they hurting her?

480

I don't know.

481

<i>Your outie.</i>

482

What?

483

I didn't say anything.

484

<i>Your outie can parallel park
in less than 20 seconds.</i>

485

<i>Your outie can roller-skate with grace.</i>

486

<i>Your outie pays all of his gas and
electric bills within three business days.</i>
