1

There was this gray hall, but then...

2

everything was, like, so white.

3

We're making progress.

4

It's not just waking up on a table.

5

It's human interaction.

6

This didn't feel human,
this felt like a nightmare.

7

I mean, why is she
rattling off a bunch of facts?

8

What are they doing to her?

9

All I know is she's essential.

10

She didn't even recognize me.

11

The Gemma you know is still in there.

12

And when you get her out, it will be
the two of you out here together.

13

Bargaining.

14

You know what that is?

15

What do you mean?

16

Well, it's one of the stages.

17

You think about all the things you'd do,

18

and all the ways you'd change
to get that person back.

19

You'd drink less. You'd listen more.

20

It's dumb, but you do it anyway.

21

It's normal.

22

Yeah.

23

But for me, it might actually happen.

24

<i>It was a sketch of a black hallway,</i>

25

with a black elevator that only goes down.

26

So there's a floor beneath us.

27

That must be where they're keeping her.

28

There were directions on the back.

29

Well, let's see it.

30

I left it there, behind the poster.

31

Why didn't you just take it?

32

I just didn't, okay?

33

I don't wanna get in trouble right now.

34

Okay. Well, I don't give a shit
about that, so I'll go get it.

35

You said it's behind the poster
of you actually being brave?

36

Okay, yeah. Fuck you.
You don't know everything.

37

Then tell us.

38

It's okay.

39

Okay. Well, I still have a hall pass,
so I can go to the break room now,

40

- and then we can start after lunch.
- Yeah. Maybe.

41

Maybe?

42

Did everyone sever their balls
in the elevator this morning?

43

I'm starving.

44

Mark?

45

Are you okay?

46

Sir?

47

Have a seat.

48

I had my performance review yesterday.

49

How did it go?

50

Many valid concerns were raised,
which I look forward to addressing.

51

I'm glad for you.

52

I feel I should remind you,

53

you cannot graduate from this fellowship

54

until I have deemed you
Wintertide material.

55

This will mean using your time well,
focusing on your own duties,

56

and eradicating
from your essence childish folly.

57

I understand, sir.

58

I shall be busy for the rest of the day.

59

I trust you can steward
the floor in my stead?

60

- Of course.
- Good.

61

You may sit at your regular desk.

62

Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

63

- <i>He threatened you?</i>
- <i>As I was leaving.</i>

64

In the elevator.

65

They're trying to intimidate us.

66

- Divide us.
- And also--

67

It's so that we won't work together,

68

because they know what will happen
if we do. I'm gonna go get that map.

69

Helly, we shared vessels.

70

What's that?

71

Well, we...

72

we had sex.

73

Okay.

74

You and... Like, in a Wellness session?

75

No. Not... Ms. Casey.

76

It was at the retreat.

77

In your tent.

78

Yeah.

79

You mean...

80

I mean, obviously, you know,
I thought it was you.

81

'Cause, you know,
I've been having those feelings since,

82

like, before the OTC.

83

So when she... I just... I had no idea, okay?

84

- Uh-huh.
- I'm sorry, Helly.

85

I... She tricked me.

86

I mean, I... you know, wanted to, but she...

87

she tricked both of us.

88

It's probably another tactic.

89

Something to drive a wedge between us.

90

- Like--
- Helly--

91

I'm gonna go for a walk.

92

Helly, I'm sorry. I thought it was you.

93

But it wasn't me.

94

Yeah, I'm just gonna go walk around.

95

First date, let me guess.

96

- Scuba.
- Thai food.

97

Nice.

98

Though you did take
scuba lessons last year.

99

Yeah? Which sea?

100

It was in a pool.

101

Okay. Cool.

102

It was a little expensive.

103

You've had a lot of phases.

104

Scuba diving, woodworking.

105

Wow. So, my outie's really diverse.

106

Garage beer-making.

107

Maybe I'm trying to find something
I excel in up there, like I do down here.

108

I sometimes wonder
if you're just not happy.

109

I'm sure it's not that.

110

'Cause, like, you know... I mean,
here, with you, I'm super happy.

111

I just, like, wanna hear
about all my offspring

112

and stare at your face.

113

- Sorry. That was weird.
- No.

114

It was really sweet.

115

I like it.

116

I like this.

117

I wish we could really be together.

118

Like, all the time.

119

I mean, we are.

120

Aren't we?

121

You and him are.

122

But I'm not.

123

Is it okay if we try the hug again?

124

I kind of like the hugging.

125

Oh, hey. I was coming to find you.

126

Same.

127

Look, I am so sorry.

128

I can't even imagine
what it must be like to--

129

You thought it was me.

130

Hundred percent.

131

Which means you wanted to.

132

With me.

133

Yeah.

134

What sucks is that she got
to have that, and I didn't.

135

That she used me to trick my friends.

136

Used my body to get close to you.

137

That she dresses me in
the morning like I'm a baby.

138

That she controls me,
and this company, and all of us.

139

It's disgusting.

140

Hey, do you want me to,
like, describe what happened?

141

Like, I feel like you
have every right to know.

142

No. I don't want her memory.

143

Okay.

144

I want my own.

145

Would you like that?

146

Yeah, I'd like that.

147

But how?

148

A tent.

149

I'm nervous.

150

Me too.

151

- You too.
- It's okay.

152

Okay.

153

Wait.

154

Yes?

155

Yes.

156

You must eradicate from
your essence childish folly.

157

You must eradicate from
yourself childish folly.

158

You must abandon childish things.

159

You must grow up.

160

You must grow up.

161

Grow up.

162

Grow up.

163

Grow up.

164

Grow.

165

Grow.

166

Grow.

167

Grow.

168

Grow.

169

Was it different with me?

170

Oh, no, you're bleeding.

171

No, you are.

172

You have two minutes left.

173

Humidity on the severed floor
is maintained at a consistent 45%.

174

It must be something else.

175

Did you punch him?

176

I mean, not today.

177

What were you doing
when the nosebleed occurred?

178

We were refining something.

179

Do you have a deviated septum?

180

Well, I don't know what that is.

181

Would you like me to put
petroleum jelly in your nostrils?

182

No, thanks.

183

Any other symptoms?

184

Any auras or hallucinations?

185

No. I think it stopped. I feel better.

186

I'm going to take your blood pressure.

187

<i>Where are you?</i>

188

I'm at Lumon.

189

- What?
- What?

190

- Fuck. I was just--
- <i>Mark?</i>

191

Wha--

192

Were you just at Lumon?

193

What time is it?

194

Are you at Lumon
or in your basement with me?

195

I don't know.

196

Do you remember a hallway?

197

A black hallway?

198

I remember... Okay.

199

I remember a desk.

200

I remember a desk.

201

I remember... Shit.

202

That was another crossover memory.

203

A recent one. That's good.

204

You'll feel gaps in time
until it all comes back together.

205

Well, when the fuck is that gonna happen?

206

We need to enhance. Speed up the process.

207

Is that safe?

208

There's a slight chance of hemorrhage.

209

Okay. So, me bleeding to death.

210

Not necessarily.

211

We'll flood the chip itself.

212

Flood the chip?

213

- Through the hole in your head.
- Jesus Christ.

214

- That you've already got.
- Okay--

215

You know what?

216

Get the fuck off me.

217

- I am not doing this, okay?
- We're close. It's happening.

218

- Get this shit off right now! Please.
- We need to push!

219

Get it off--

220

God. I'm fu... I'm starving.

221

That's also from reintegration.

222

Okay, you know what?

223

I'm gonna go eat.

224

Fuck.

225

Hello.

226

Who the hell are you?

227

It's a joke.

228

- Come on in. Hey.
- Okay.

229

What the heck?

230

Fields is tending the ham.

231

I hope you like a cumin glaze.

232

Yes, of course.

233

- Do you not?
- No, I do.

234

Attila.

235

Yes, Attila?

236

Did you just ask about the glaze?

237

- I did.
- Well, don't.

238

I've already put it on.

239

I was gonna say we also have corn.

240

Oh, yes.

241

We could feed him a pile of loose corn.

242

What your innie ever saw
in this Philistine

243

is beyond me.

244

Fields, I presume.

245

Yes.

246

- Irving.
- Irving.

247

Yes.

248

Welcome back to our home.

249

Yes. I'm sorry about the last time.

250

I'm sure that felt quite invasive.

251

Nonsense.

252

What's mine's yours.

253

And you've brought wine.

254

Irving, no one's ever thrown blood
on you on your way into work?

255

- No.
- It wasn't blood. It was paint.

256

Meant to evoke blood.

257

Not what you said.

258

The Whole Mind people
are off the deep end, is my point.

259

And, Burt, how did
you come to be at the company?

260

- Me?
- Yes, I'm very curious.

261

Well, as a matter of fact,
I was guided to Lumon's door by Jesus.

262

Jesus Christ?

263

That's the one.

264

You should just leave it at that, and
let him wonder what the hell you meant.

265

No, we'd been attending
the Lutheran church for some years.

266

And I should mention that I'd been
what you might call a scoundrel

267

in my younger days.

268

To put it mildly.

269

So, one Sunday at breakfast,
Fields asked me point blank,

270

do I think I'm going to heaven?

271

As one asks at breakfast.

272

I pretend to think about it,
but I know the answer is no.

273

To which I replied, "What am I supposed to
do up there for eternity all by myself?"

274

- I see.
- So we hop on the train to church,

275

and it so happens the sermon that day
is about severance...

276

- Yeah.
- ...which was still very new at the time.

277

And the pastor says--

278

As if he'd been listening
to our conversation,

279

he said the church's stance
is that innies are, you know,

280

complete individuals, with souls...

281

that can be judged
separately from their outie.

282

So, an innie can go to heaven.

283

Whilst the outie burns.

284

We're not zealots, I swear.

285

But we figured that if it were true,

286

it may be a way for part of Burt to--

287

You know...

288

Wow.

289

- He's looking for the exit.
- No, it's just--

290

So, the hope was for Burt's
innie to go to heaven.

291

Yes. With me.

292

Gretch, it's the end of the month.

293

Those salesmen are just dying to hit
their numbers and get cars off the lot.

294

They'll basically be giving me money.

295

Okay. Fine.

296

Just test drive only.

297

I won't commit to anything.

298

- Thank you.
- No.

299

You didn't tell me how'd it go.
You went back to Lumon, right?

300

No.

301

That good?

302

They canceled it.

303

I didn't see him... you.

304

- Happy plate.
- Happy plate.

305

Go play with your sister.

306

Canceled it? What happened?

307

They didn't say. Guess you got too busy.

308

- Hey. Buddy. Try it. No. Okay.
- No.

309

Thank you.

310

Mark Scout.

311

Thought that was you.
I'm Helena Eagan. I work at Lumon.

312

Yeah. No, I know who you are.

313

Well, it's nice to officially meet you.

314

Have you had enough to eat?

315

Yeah, quite possibly.

316

I hope they're feeding you at work.

317

May I?

318

Please.

319

It's really great to run into you.

320

I've heard nothing but good things
about your work, by the way.

321

Thank you. I've heard nothing at all
about my work, so...

322

Severance humor. That's so clever.

323

And so easy.

324

Look, I'm sorry for the systemic error
from the other night.

325

The systemic error?

326

You mean the overtime thing?

327

Yes. The OTC.

328

It never should have happened,
and it never will again.

329

We take pride as a company to be better
than that, and we will be better.

330

- Well, that's nice to hear. Thanks.
- Of course.

331

So, you know all about it then.

332

Yes, I know all about it.

333

I'm, like, the head of the company, Mark.

334

Right. Dumb. Sorry.

335

Yeah, you should be sorry.

336

- Really? Okay.
- I'm kidding.

337

You're clearly not dumb.

338

I don't know. You...

339

You're the one who invented
a revolutionary medical procedure.

340

Hey, now, that was not me.

341

That was my father.

342

Uh-huh.

343

You should meet him sometime.

344

Your father?

345

Sure. Why not?

346

You wanna take me home to Dad already?

347

Yeah, I think it's finally time.

348

Okay. Sure. Let's do it.

349

You'd be the first.

350

- So, no pressure.
- Yeah. None whatsoever.

351

But seriously, I'd love to hear
about your experiences sometime.

352

Okay. Yeah.

353

About severance?

354

I meant the overtime con...
I meant the other night.

355

I mean, I can't imagine how confusing
that must have been.

356

Traumatic, even.

357

And I know you've already been through
so much with losing your wife and all.

358

Hanna.

359

Gemma.

360

Right. Gemma. Sorry.

361

It was a car accident, right?

362

That's right.

363

Yeah, such a shame.

364

She was so young.

365

Thank you.

366

Are you all right?

367

I'm fine. I'm just about finished here.

368

Okay. Right.

369

Well, it was nice to meet you, Helena.

370

Yeah. You too, Mark.

371

What is it?

372

Nothing.

373

Good night.

374

We used to call each other hon,

375

then about ten years ago
that became Attila.

376

Because... Do you know history?

377

- Yeah.
- He knows history.

378

And it wasn't ten years ago. It was 20.

379

- No.
- Yes!

380

Because I remember we were having drinks
with your Lumon partner.

381

Quite startled him.

382

Didn't the first severed office
open 12 years ago?

383

- Yes, it did.
- Yeah.

384

Maybe that's enough of that.

385

You know the corn is very special.

386

Do you think you two
ever made love at work?

387

Fields, Jesus.

388

Can we not just be
pragmatic adults about this?

389

There is a nonzero chance that
the two of you had unprotected sex.

390

And so, I felt the right to ask.

391

Are you done humiliating our guest?

392

Sounds like I'm mad, but I'm not.

393

Cards on the table.

394

I've been talking to
Pastor Gale about this,

395

and I believe that
innies deserve to experience love.

396

I mean it.

397

And I hope it was beautiful.

398

Sorry for being a dick.

399

Let's do it.

400

Tonight.

401

There.

402

How long will it take?

403

It'll be fast.

404

Fast. How fast?

405

<i>I'm nervous.</i>

406

<i>Yes.</i>

407

What the fuck?

408

Don't move like that.

409

You have to keep your head still.

410

Ignore it.

411

Tell me--

412

Mark?

413

My car's in the driveway.
She knows I'm here.

414

No...

415

- Mark.
- Yeah?

416

Hey.

417

Dude, I left you, like, five messages.
Are you better?

418

No, I'm still sick.

419

Well, you can't not pick up when
we're doing corporate espionage shit.

420

The floodlight thing was a bust, right?

421

Because I have had an idea
that is a little dumber.

422

Okay, Devon...

423

Do you remember
the rich lady from baby camp?

424

The one I, like, kind of had a crush on?

425

- I was thinking--
- Yeah. Look,

426

I'm already trying something else.

427

Okay. What are you trying?

428

Just don't worry about it.

429

- What the fuck does that mean?
- I'm doing it myself.

430

Fuck that.

431

Why are you trying to cut me out of this?

432

Shit.

433

I'm really not, Devon.

434

- You literally are.
- Okay, fine.

435

I am, but I didn't ask for your help!

436

Fuck you, officially.

437

And what is that smell?

438

What smell?

439

440

Oh, my God.

441

Mark.

442

Don't touch him.

443

Who the fuck are you?

444

Mark?

445

It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

446

It's okay.

447

Thank you for the spare ham.

448

Is Fields...

449

He's fine. He'll be embarrassed tomorrow.

450

You know, he gets fuzzy.

451

Like saying I worked
at Lumon 20 years ago,

452

which is, of course,
before severance even existed.

453

Of course.

454

- Sorry.
- No, this was fun.

455

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

456

So, we should do it again sometime.

457

You, me, Fields? Or you, me?

458

No, I meant with Fields.

459

- Yeah.
- Yeah?

460

Yeah. But, you know, it's either way.

461

Good.

462

- Good night, Burt.
- Good night.
