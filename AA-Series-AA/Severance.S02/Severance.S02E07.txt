All set.

2

Thanks.

3

What do you got there?

4

Sorry. What do you got there?

5

Themes of religious conversion
in Tolstoy's <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>.

6

Oh, my God. Spoiler alert, please.

7

What about you?

8

- Are you reading...
- Me? Well... It's...

9

Oh, yeah, this is a real treat.

10

"All Quiet on the Western Blunt:

11

Drug Use by Enlisted Soldiers
during World War I."

12

- No, stop.
- No, that's what it is.

13

Kid's a genius.
You should flunk every other child.

14

I couldn't agree more.

15

I'm sorry. Who are you?

16

Gemma.

17

All right.

18

Mark.

19

- Nice to meet you, Mark.
- You too.

20

Gemma, where did you go?

21

He'll be okay.

22

There might be some deficits.

23

Hopefully, nothing long term.

24

Are you a doctor?

25

Do we need an ambulance?

26

Can you answer
one of my questions, please?

27

- Do we need an ambulance?
- No.

28

He's gonna sleep for a while.

29

Okay. How long?

30

Hard to say.

31

We'll need some equipment
from downstairs. Are you clumsy?

32

What? Why do you have equipment
in Mark's basement?

33

Your brother's reintegrating.

34

No, he's not.

35

- I know that was troubling.
- Okay.

36

I can tell that you're smarter than me,

37

so forgive me if I say this,
like, super plainly,

38

but if you give one solitary thought
to messing with my brother again,

39

I will throw you off a fucking bridge.

40

- Devon--
- We don't do that again.

41

- We'll discuss it later.
- Nope!

42

No. It's settled fucking law, lady, okay?

43

Just accept it.

44

The end.

45

It's what he wants.

46

What he wants is to know
whether Gemma's alive or not.

47

She is.

48

Please don't mess with me.

49

She is alive.

50

You've eaten today, honey?

51

Yes.

52

Done your reading?

53

Fifty pages.

54

Calisthenics?

55

Yes.

56

If you were caught in a mudslide,

57

would you be more afraid
of suffocating or drowning?

58

Drowning.

59

How many rooms today?

60

Six.

61

Shit.

62

Ready?

63

There she is.

64

Could I please get a break?

65

Just for a little while.

66

But it's been six weeks.

67

I was just here.

68

I know.

69

Nobody likes the dentist.

70

I should have been an accountant
like my mom wanted.

71

Please, have a seat.

72

Excellent.

73

Now, let's see how we're doing.

74

Open wide, please.

75

How long was I in there?

76

Two hours.

77

Okay.

78

Oh, bud.

79

I need you back, m'lady.

80

Please come back.

81

- Hey. Oh, bless you.
- Hey.

82

Excuse me.

83

- Hi.
- Hey.

84

That was fun last night.

85

It was.

86

I'm sorry. I have a lecture at 3:00
on <i>Hadji Murad</i>

87

- and my notes are all over the place.
- No. That's... It's okay.

88

I just... I brought you something.

89

It's an ant farm.

90

Last night you said you liked ants. So...

91

I said I liked... I like plants.

92

Plants.

93

- I hate ants.
- Oh, shit.

94

- But I... I love farms.
- Good.

95

I'm so fucking behind.

96

I'm not even here.

97

You're not here? Okay.

98

What are you doing? What are you doing?

99

Yeah.

100

- Really?
- Well, I mean, you know, it was on sale.

101

And who's putting it together,
Mr. Handyman? You?

102

I happen to be quite handy.

103

No, you're not.

104

- What? How dare you.
- Handsy.

105

Handsy?

106

All right. Maybe I am kinda handsy.

107

- Yeah?
- I like it.

108

Yeah. Well...

109

This is what I was hoping would come up.

110

What happened?

111

It really, truly wasn't that bad.

112

For you. That's 'cause you can
scale walls like a gecko.

113

This... It was like half a mile
of just exposed rock face.

114

- Boulders. Fine.
- It sounds fun.

115

There were a few boulders.

116

Boulders? Babe, come on.
It was like the death zone of Everest.

117

Like Chomolungma.

118

- Any frozen bodies?
- No, I looked.

119

But I do have photo evidence.
Look at them.

120

- Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?
- Look.

121

- Yeah, Ricken, what is wrong with you?
- Yeah.

122

Hey, I belayed my first couloir
in middle school.

123

- So, I...
- What?

124

What?

125

- That sounds painful.
- We all know what that means.

126

I'm sorry he said that.

127

Outdoorsmanship courses through my veins.

128

- I think it's hot.
- I make no apology for it.

129

Wait, how did you get down?

130

- I scooted on my ass.
- Are there photos of that?

131

No. It was a no-photo zone.

132

A no-photo death zone.

133

Exactly. Thank you.

134

You and I will ramble together someday.
The two of us.

135

It will be a grand adventure.

136

I feel like we spend
a lot of time together.

137

- Not enough. No, Mark.
- Really?

138

- Are you not drinking?
- What are we gonna do there?

139

Did you know you can purify urine into...

140

- Oh, fuck right off.
- ...drinkable water?

141

Why would I do that?

142

To experience the beauty
and wonder of nature.

143

But why is it you want to do this so bad?

144

- Okay.
- I want to know you better.

145

Why is it you need
to have me come with you...

146

Hey, hon. Do you know
where I put the keys?

147

- Are you okay? Oh, baby.
- No.

148

Ms. Casey.

149

I'm here to observe Helly R.

150

No one told me.

151

Ms. Cobel's orders.
I am to watch her for signs of sadness,

152

and verbally encourage her
to forgo further suicide attempts.

153

Are the severance barriers holding?

154

Yes, the technology is working.

155

You like her.

156

She's easy to like.

157

She is fond of me too, of course.

158

Didn't she try and break your fingers?

159

Hi. I'll be right with you.

160

Thanks.

161

You know...

162

it's the next step for a lot of people.

163

I love you.

164

I love you too.

165

I'm sorry.

166

You ready?

167

It's time.

168

Locked and loaded.

169

Third time's the charm.

170

That's what they say.

171

I'll write you a thank-you note.

172

You hate writing thank-you notes.

173

Oh, my God. I'm a little nervous.

174

Baby?

175

I said I'm a little nervous.

176

Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

177

it's the final step and, you know,

178

there's a kid that's out there
just waiting for us.

179

Just got to reach out and grab her. Right?

180

What if it doesn't work?

181

Turn around and bend over.

182

Sorry. You okay?

183

<i>How are you feeling?</i>

184

<i>My mouth hurts.</i>

185

<i>Which room caused your mouth to hurt?</i>

186

<i>The first one.</i>

187

Wellington.

188

How many rooms did you visit today?

189

Six.

190

The Billings room, the Lucknow room,

191

St. Pierre, Cairns, Zurich, and...

192

The Wellington room.

193

The Wellington. Excellent.

194

And what happened in the rooms?
You remember nothing?

195

Nothing.

196

How did you feel in the hall?

197

Did you exit any of the rooms
feeling despair?

198

Fervor? Gaiety?

199

There's only one room
I haven't been to yet,

200

and today it had a name on it.

201

Cold Harbor.

202

So, what happens,
once I've been in all the rooms?

203

You will see the world again,
and the world will see you.

204

So, I'll see Mark?

205

Mark will benefit
from the world you're siring.

206

Kier will take away all his pain,
just as Kier has taken away yours.

207

Can you please just talk
like a normal person?

208

Good night, Gemma. Dream sweet.

209

Gemma, coffee's ready!

210

Is he okay?

211

He's stable.

212

It was an isolated event.

213

He's journeying now.

214

When will he wake up?

215

When he's ready to.

216

Great.

217

You really think this is gonna work?

218

There's no other choice.

219

There's an innie cabin.

220

Come again?

221

There... I mean, it's technically...

222

It's a cottage where severed people
become their innies,

223

and there was this woman--

224

Damona Birthing Retreat.

225

Well, so maybe if we go to the cabin,
we could talk to his innie, and he could--

226

They're two completely different things.

227

This is how you get Gemma out.

228

Really, this? Because this looks like
how you kill my brother.

229

You two are definitely related.

230

- I could call her.
- Who?

231

- Harmony Cobel.
- What? Why would you do that?

232

She runs the severed floor.

233

Not anymore, she doesn't.
She might know how to get in the cabin.

234

And, fuck, she might know
how to get to Gemma.

235

She's Lumon through and through.

236

She was raised by them. She's a soldier.

237

- It's a risk. I get that.
- A risk?

238

- Yeah.
- She will turn you over to them.

239

Both of us.

240

Everything I've done to fight, gone.

241

We resume the treatment
as soon as he wakes up.

242

Okay. I have custody
of his brain now. You don't.

243

I'm calling her.

244

- Well, then, I can't be a part of this.
- What?

245

If you do that... If you make that choice...

246

What are you...
No, seriously, what are you doing?

247

- Good luck.
- You can't leave him like this.

248

No, no, no, I can't do this without you.

249

You... Are you kidding?

250

You're leaving now?

251

This... This isn't my choice. It's yours.

252

No, I need you to stay. I can't...

253

I don't know what to do with this.
What do I do if he wakes up?

254

Do not call that woman.

255

Oh, my God.

256

Hey.

257

Chi...

258

- Mark?
- Chikha... Chikha...

259

- What are you trying to say?
- Chikhai...

260

Chik...

261

<i>Chikhai bardo?</i>

262

I don't know.
It looks like two guys fighting.

263

No, it's the same guy fighting himself,
defeating his own psyche. Ego death.

264

How do you know it's the same guy?

265

Well, the hair's the same.

266

That thing came in the mail?

267

Yeah. It's one of those things
where you have to draw a duck

268

or a rabbit or whatever.

269

I think I got onto the mailing list
at the clinic.

270

Why are you wasting your time with this?

271

Why are you being an asshole?

272

I'm not. I'm just... I don't know.
It seems kind of...

273

- weird.
- I'm enjoying this.

274

Or was, until you ruined it.

275

I think you might be
overreacting a little bit, Gemma.

276

Don't do that.

277

Do what?

278

- Tell me how I'm feeling.
- I have no idea how you're feeling.

279

Like shit. Beat to shit.

280

So let's stop.

281

It's okay. This is perfectly normal.

282

Let's get you set up with that meal.
Bon appétit.

283

Can I get you anything else? Coffee? Tea?

284

Another pillow...

285

He's stuck at 96%.

286

The nose bleeds set us back.

287

When he's done,
you're gonna have to say goodbye to her.

288

<i>I'm aware.</i>

289

<i>For Kier.</i>

290

For Kier.

291

Why are you wearing that stupid sweater?

292

<i>Dear Mr. Tisdale,</i>

293

<i>I cannot thank you enough...</i>

294

<i>for the thoughtful Christmas gift</i>

295

<i>you sent my husband and I this year.</i>

296

We have never owned

297

an electric grouter.

298

And we look forward

299

to the many happy

300

memories

301

it will

302

provide.

303

Come on now, sweetheart.
It's the last one.

304

Nothing...

305

says...

306

Christmas like...

307

grouting.

308

It's actually a de-grouter,

309

but close enough.

310

How much longer do I have to do this?

311

I told you, you're done.

312

But Christmas has a funny way
of coming back around each year.

313

It's always Christmas.

314

Let's go.

315

I love you.

316

I said, "I love you."

317

I love you too.

318

Hello, Gemma.

319

Dr. Mauer.

320

How are you feeling?

321

My hand hurts.

322

And what room caused your hand to hurt?

323

Allentown.

324

I want to go home.

325

Your husband remarried last year...

326

and he has a daughter now.

327

I don't believe you.

328

You've been gone a long time, Gemma.

329

He's moved on.

330

Maybe you've moved on too.

331

In one of the rooms. What do you think?

332

Do you feel yourself gravitating
towards one room or another?

333

Maybe you felt things behind those doors
you never felt with Mark.

334

Maybe I've seen it.

335

<i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>.

336

Let me guess. He dies at the end.

337

Gemma!

338

Gemma! Stop!

339

Gemma!

340

Hey.

341

You sure you don't want to come?

342

- It's charades.
- That's gonna be, like, 20 minutes of it.

343

Yeah. But, you know.

344

Or I could stay?

345

No, you should probably go.

346

I mean, this thing's
gotta be in tonight anyway, so...

347

Okay. Did you get the Denali thing I sent?

348

The... No.

349

I'll look at it. I'll check it out.

350

All right. Well, I'll be back
at, like, 10:00.

351

Okay.

352

I love you.

353

- I said--
- Oh, no, I love you too, hon. I'm sorry.

354

- Bye.
- See you.

Ms. Casey.

357

Mr. Milchick.

358

I'm so sorry.

359

What's happening?

360

Nothing.

361

Your outie came in
for a public art exhibition

362

and found herself in the wrong elevator.

363

How long have I been--

364

If you wouldn't mind turning around
and heading back in,

365

it would be greatly appreciated.

366

- But--
- On you go.

367

- Where's--
- Thank you, Ms. Casey.

368

No.

369

Mark.

370

- Come on.
- Mark.

371

Mark?

372

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

373

Hi.

374

Hey.

375

Careful. Easy.

376

Oh, Mark.

377

Where'd you go?
