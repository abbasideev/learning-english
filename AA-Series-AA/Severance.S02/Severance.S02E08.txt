You hear about that
clusterfuck up on North Pine?

2

Dutch Stevens' kid.

3

How the fuck do you flip
a two-ton snow plow?

4

With stupidity.

5

The apple don't fall far from the gutter.

6

Well, that's kind of you.

7

On the house.

8

Thank you.

9

Hey, Rose.

10

You want a refill?

11

You can top me off anytime.

12

I like the new do.

13

<i>Tr√®s chic.</i>

14

Harmony Cobel.

15

Well, flip my toboggan.

16

You want coffee?

17

No.

18

Tables are for paying customers.

19

Fine. Then buy me a coffee.

20

The town is older than I remember.

21

Frailer.

22

Yeah, well, with the market readjustment
from a few years ago

23

and the fluctuating interest rates,

24

there was a retrenchment from some
of the core infrastructure investments.

25

I need a favor.

26

But not here.

27

Meet me at the factory.

28

- Hey, Dot. Close up for me.
- Sure.

29

You know how fucked it is
to ask me to come here?

30

I need you to drive me to Sissy's.

31

No, thanks.

32

If they're watching the house,
they'll recognize my car.

33

How much trouble are you in?

34

Enough.

35

You know she still lives by the nine?

36

I assumed.

37

Then you know she's a fucking pariah here.

38

You can stay in the truck.

39

I need to get something.

40

Why would I help you with anything?

41

We were once chums.

42

Old colleagues lift each other up.

43

Colleagues?

44

Child fucking labor.

45

Kier and Imogene met at the Ether Mill,

46

you know that?

47

Was she hacking up a lung at the time?

48

I can smell it on your breath.

49

Pathetic.

50

Fuck you.

51

You can help me or not.

52

But I'll not be the punching dummy
for your resentments.

53

Coast is clear.

54

You're higher than a bearded vulture.

55

Tell her to drop dead for me.

56

You are not welcome here.

57

This is trespass.

58

I have a mind to call the authorities.

59

I do not want that huff peddler
on my property.

60

You gave him his thirst for it.

61

You've a liar's mouth.

62

Do you want to come down here
and tell me what this is all about?

63

What have you done with my things?

64

Sold. To the poor.

65

They weren't yours to sell.

66

I sit in this house.

67

You do not.

68

Has anyone been here?

69

No one comes here.

70

Or telephoned?

71

A Mr. Drummond.

72

And what did he want?

73

What have you done, little mouse?

74

Harmony!

75

I want the key to Mother's room.

76

That room stays shut
until all who remember her sit with Kier.

77

You know this.

78

Give me the key.

79

Why do you bring nothing but woe
into my life?

80

No, it is you who cursed this house
with woe.

81

I will not have this quarrel.

82

What were her last words?

83

Child, do not test me.

84

What were they?

85

She said nothing after you pulled the tube
from her gullet.

86

There was gratitude in her eyes
to be freed from her suffering.

87

If only she had been a believer.

88

Perhaps she would have found solace
in the nine.

89

You didn't have to listen to her wheezing
as I did, day after day.

90

I would have cared for her myself,
had I not been at school.

91

Where you belonged.

92

I didn't even get to say goodbye.

93

Your studies were more important.

94

Mr. Eagan saw Kier in you.

95

He really did.

96

And the Wintertide Fellowship--

97

Even at the factory, no apprentice
was more industrious than you.

98

Such a disappointment you've proven to be.

99

What did Drummond tell you?

100

Return and plead forgiveness, child.

101

The Eagans will grant it.

102

And show me mercy,

103

just like you did with Mother.

104

Where is the key?

105

All you will find in there is pain.

106

Where is it?

107

I found it!

108

Come on.

109

Don't! Stand away!

110

Get your harpy hands off me.

111

You've no salutation here,
you blighted snuff slave.

112

All right, I missed you too.
You smell like crow skin.

113

I'll phone somebody. I swear it!

114

Yeah, call everyone.
We'll have a fucking kegger.

115

This is a pure house.

116

Back off or I'll put you in the bay!

117

What is it? What happened?

118

Nothing. Came to get you.

119

She's not too happy about it.

120

Did you see something?

121

No, but it's cold as shit in the truck,
and I gotta get back.

122

I have to find it.

123

Find what?

124

Just give me a minute just to think.

125

I liked her.

126

You barely knew her.

127

She hated Lumon more than I did.

128

That's all I needed to know.

129

At least she doesn't have to live
with Sissy anymore.

130

You wanna get high?

131

Wow.

132

I haven't done that since I was eight.

133

You ready to man the vat for ten hours?

134

It's so shameful that you sell it.

135

I don't think it's here.

136

What you're looking for.

137

Get out of here!

138

She wouldn't throw it away.

139

Find it?

140

Get the truck ready. And watch my head.

141

I'm going. Don't tell them I was here.

142

I would never bear falsity
to a steward of the Eagans.

143

Lumon destroyed this town.

144

You owe them no loyalty.

145

There was no town before the factory.

146

And what about your own employ?

147

Everything that you have,
you owe back to the Eagans as fealty.

148

Fealty?

149

Mine!

150

My designs!

151

Circuit blueprint...

152

Base code...

153

Overtime contingency...

154

Glasgow block. All of it.

155

Jame Eagan was the inventor.

156

So I've heard.

157

158

Extraordinary.

159

Why have you never spoken of this?

160

It was told Kier's knowledge is for all.

161

That is true.

162

That if I sought credit,
I would be banished.

163

I hope you die as painfully as she did.

164

It was her hand that removed the tube,
not mine.

165

No!

166

Your mother was a coward.

167

More sick in the soul than in the body.

168

Filled with malice and resentment.

169

I don't believe you!

170

I thought you were different...

171

my flower.

172

I tried to help you grow.

173

But now I see you are a weed,
just as she was.

174

Hey! Someone's comin'!

175

You better get going.

176

Hampton.

177

I'll see you around.

178

Come and tame these tempers, assholes.

179

<i>Mrs. Selvig? Thank fuck,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

180

Yes, I'm aware.

181

<i>So, listen, Mark has been reintegrating.</i>

182

Reghabi?

183

<i>Yeah.</i>

184

And she hasn't killed him yet?

185

<i>No. I mean, I think he's okay?</i>

186

<i>But listen, we wanna try something else.</i>

187

Is Mark with you?

188

- <i>Uh-huh. Yes.</i>
- Put him on.

189

<i>Yeah. Hello?</i>

190

Tell me everything.
